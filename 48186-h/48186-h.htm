<h2><a name="PREFACE_TO_NEW_EDITION" id="PREFACE_TO_NEW_EDITION">PREFACE TO NEW EDITION.</a></h2>
<p>Some forty years ago the commencement and partial
    preparation of this work assisted to beguile the tedium
    of a winter&rsquo;s residence from home, where even Orange
    and Magnolia groves with the novel vegetation of a semi-tropical
    region, could scarcely dispel the ennui attending
    a life of idleness.</p>
<p>We were then fresh from contact with some earnest
    rose lovers abroad. Rivers in England had impressed
    us with his enthusiastic energy, and, in Paris, the force
    of Hardy, the industry of Vibert and the charming
    manners of Laffay left enjoyable memories. For many
    interesting facts we were much indebted to Deslongchamps
    and several anonymous writers. To the former
    our obligations were due, both for the plan of this work
    and for many researches to which his name could not be
    conveniently attached on its pages.</p>
<p>Upon the classification we bestowed much thought,
    and now, after many years, we think it is still the best
    we could have made. Rose growers will, we think, find
    the labor of selection much diminished by its simplicity.</p>
<p>In directions for culture, we give the results of our
    own experience, and have not hesitated to avail ourselves
    of any satisfactory results in the experience of others
    which might enhance the utility of the work.</p>
<p>In the list of sorts published with the first edition
    there were nearly two thousand names. So great has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> been the increase of varieties in forty years that it would
    be a work of labor to enumerate them. Some of the
    best varieties in the first edition are still the best, and
    in revising the list of sorts we have not thrown out all
    of these. Of the newer hardy sorts we have adopted
    some which are recommended by Mr. Paul, and many
    others of which our judgment is confirmed by that
    of Mr. John Henderson, whose opinion cannot be questioned.
    The large scale on which Mr. Henderson has
    for many years <i>forced</i> roses for cut flowers makes his
    opinion of tender classes especially valuable, and we have
    placed in our list, without hesitation, his favorite sorts.</p>
<p>We have stricken out much of the poetry, which to
    the cultivator may have seemed irrelevant if not worthless,
    and for the interest of the classical scholar, have
    retained much of the early history of the Rose, and its
    connection with the manners and customs of the two
    great nations of a former age.</p>
<p>For our labor we shall feel abundantly compensated,
    if this work, in its revised form, shall in any way tend
    to produce a more general admiration and increased
    culture of the most beautiful flower known.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>
<h3>BOTANICAL CLASSIFICATION.</h3>
<p>The Rose is a shrub or dwarf tree, with mostly deciduous
    foliage, and large, beautiful, and fragrant flowers. Its
    branches are slender, almost always armed with thorns,
    thinly furnished with leaves, which are alternate upon the
    stem. Its leaves are pinnate, and vary in color and character,
    from the rich, dark green, and somewhat rough leaf
    of La Reine, to the glossy smoothness and rich purple
    edge of Chromatella. The blossoms are variously arranged
    at the extremity of the newly formed branches.
    The calyx is single and tubular, swelling at its lower part,
    contracted at its opening, and divided at the edge into
    five lance-pointed divisions, which are whole or pinnatifid.
    The corolla is inserted at the mouth of the tube of
    the calyx, and is composed of five heart-shaped petals,
    which constitute the Rose in its single or natural state.
    The double blossoms are formed by the change of the
    stamens and pistils into petals or flower leaves, shorter
    than those of the corolla proper. The fruit or seed vessel,
    or <i>hip</i>, is formed by the tube of the calyx, which becomes
    plump and juicy, globular or oviform, having but
    one cell, and containing numerous small, one-seeded, dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> fruits, which usually pass for seeds; these are oval or
    globular, and surrounded with a soft down. The wood
    is very hard and compact, and of fine grain; and if it
    could be procured of sufficient size, would serve as a substitute
    for box in many kinds of manufacture. The longevity
    of the Rose is, perhaps, greater than that of any
    other shrub. We recollect seeing a rose-tree near an old
    castle in Stoke Newington, England, the stem of which
    was of immense size, and indicated great age. &ldquo;There is
    a rose-bush flourishing at the residence of A. Murray
    McIlvaine, near Bristol, (Penn.,) known to be more than
    a hundred years old. In the year 1742, there was a
    kitchen built, which encroached on the corner of the garden,
    and the masons laid the corner-stone with great care,
    saying &lsquo;it was a pity to destroy so pretty a bush.&rsquo; Since
    then, it has never failed to produce a profusion of roses,
    shedding around the most delicious of all perfumes.
    Sometimes it has climbed for years over the second-story
    windows, and then declined by degrees to the ordinary
    height. The fifth generation is now regaled with its
    sweets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The number of species known to the ancients was small,
    compared with the number now recognized by botanists.
    Pliny, with whom we find the most detail on this point,
    says that the most esteemed were those of Præneste and
    Pæstum, which were, perhaps, identical; those of Campania
    and Malta, of a bright red color, and having but
    twelve petals; the white roses of Heraclea, in Greece,
    and those of Alabande, which seem to be identical with <i>R. centifolia</i>. According to the Roman naturalist and to
    Theophrastus, they grew naturally on Mount Panga, and
    produced there very small flowers; yet the inhabitants of
    Philippi went there to obtain them, and the bushes on being
    transplanted, produced much improved and beautiful
    roses. Pliny speaks also of some other species, one whose
    flowers were single, another which he terms <i>Spinola</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> also that of Carthage, which bloomed in winter. Unfortunately,
    all that we find in his works on this subject is,
    generally, very obscure, and it is difficult to compare many
    he has described with those known at the present day.</p>
<p>Although there are no double wild roses known at the
    present day, either in Europe or in this country, yet, as
    other flowers have been found double in a wild state, it is
    not impossible that some of the ancient varieties bore
    double flowers in their native condition in the fields. Such
    may have been the <i>Centifolias</i>, mentioned by Pliny and
    Theophrastus, as growing upon Mount Panga, and those
    which, at a still earlier period, according to Herodotus,
    grew wild in Macedonia, near the ancient gardens of
    Midas.</p>
<p>The poverty in description which we have observed in
    ancient writings, and their comparatively small number
    of species, extends also to a much later day. In a little
    treatise published in France in 1536, and entitled <i>De re
    Hortensis Libellus</i>, there are but four species mentioned,
    and scarcely anything concerning their culture. An
    Italian work published in 1563 mentions only eight species.
    In the <i>Florilegium</i> of Sweet, a folio volume printed
    at Frankfort in 1612, are ten very coarse representations
    of roses, but with no indication of their names.</p>
<p>In the <i>Paradisus Terrestris</i> of Parkinson, a folio volume
    printed at London in 1629, some twenty-four kinds are
    mentioned. Some of them are represented by figures in
    wood, which are very coarse, and scarcely allow recognition
    of their species. In the <i>Jardinier Hollandois</i>, printed
    at Amsterdam in 1669, are found but fourteen species
    of roses, very vaguely described, with scarcely anything
    on culture.</p>
<p>The first work which treated of roses with any degree
    of method is that of La Quintyne, published at Paris in
    1690, and yet its details of the different species and varieties
    do not occupy more than a page and a half, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> twenty-one pages are given to the culture of tulips, and
    fifty to pinks. Though he describes two hundred and
    twenty-five varieties of pinks, and four hundred and thirteen
    tulips, he mentions only fourteen species and varieties
    of roses. For a century subsequent to the publication of
    La Quintyne&rsquo;s work, the Rose is very little mentioned,
    either in English or French works, and there is nothing
    to indicate the existence at that time of many species,
    two or three only being required for medicine and perfumery.
    Some of the English collections, however, numbered
    during that century some twenty-two distinct species,
    and a number of varieties. In 1762, Linnæus was
    acquainted with only fourteen species. In 1799, Wildenow,
    in his <i>Species Plantarum</i>, mentioned thirty-nine;
    and Persoon, a little later, reached forty-five species; De
    Candolle, in his <i>Prodromus</i>, published in 1825, increased
    the number to one hundred and forty-six; and
    Don, in 1832, makes two hundred and five species. If to
    these are added those which have been within fifteen years
    discovered in the Himalaya Mountains, and in other parts
    of the globe, the number will be greatly increased.</p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>Many of those enumerated by Don should not, in truth,
    be considered distinct species, and quite a number are
    nothing more than varieties. In fact, roses are so liable
    to pass into each other, that botanists are now of the
    opinion that limits between many of those called species
    do not exist; a fact which was strongly suspected by
    Linnæus, when he said, &ldquo;Species limitibus difficillime circumscribuntur,
    et forte natura non eos posuit.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>There is much confusion in the genus Rosa, and in the
    best arrangement there may be many, which, on close
    examination, would scarcely deserve the name of species.
    The best scientific work on the Rose is the &ldquo;Monographia
    Rosarum,&rdquo; by Dr. Lindley. This author, and Loudon, we
    shall follow entirely in our botanical classification. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> latter enumerates several other works on the Rose, which
    are not within our reach.</p>
<p>The Rose is found in almost every part of the northern
    hemisphere, between the 19th and 70th degrees of latitude.</p>
<p>Captain Fremont, (now General Fremont) in his description
    of the prairies some five hundred miles west of
    St. Louis, says, &ldquo;Everywhere the Rose is met with, and
    reminds us of cultivated gardens and civilization. It is
    scattered over the prairies in small bouquets, and, when
    glittering in the dews and waving in the pleasant breeze
    of the early morning, is the most beautiful of the prairie
    flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is found from the mountains of Mexico to Hudson&rsquo;s
    Bay, from the coast of Barbary to Sweden, in Lapland
    and Siberia, from Spain to the Indies, China, and Kamschatka.
    &ldquo;In Asia, half the species have been found; of
    the thirty-nine which it produces, eighteen are natives of
    the Russian dominions and the countries adjacent. Most
    of these are very similar to the European portion of the
    genus, and five are common to both Europe and Asia.
    Of the remainder, one, which is, perhaps, a distinct genus,
    has been discovered in Persia, fifteen in China, and two
    of the latter, with four others, in the north of India.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We shall not here describe all the species mentioned by
    Lindley and Loudon; but only those which are the parents
    of our garden sorts. A large part of the species
    described by these authors cannot be found in any collection
    in this country; and, in fact, very few possess any
    interest except to the botanist. The descriptions here
    given are mainly abbreviated from those of Loudon.</p>

        stout, recurved, in many instances in pairs. Leaflets
        5-9, obovate, subserrate, coriaceous, glossy, glabrous.
        Stipules scarcely attached to the petiole, bristle-shaped,
        but fringed. Peduncles and calyxes tomentose. Flowers
        showy, pure white, solitary, nearly sessile. Fruit spherical,
        orange red. Native of China; growing to the height
        of five feet or six feet, and flowering from June to October.</p>

<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><b>PIMPINELLIFOLIÆ.</b> <span class="smcap">Lindl.</span></p>
<p>Plants bearing crowded, nearly equal, prickles, or unarmed.
    Bractless, rarely bracteate. Leaflets ovate or
    oblong. Sepals connivent, permanent. Disk almost
    wanting.</p>
<p>This section is essentially different from the last in
    habit, but in artificial characters they approach very nearly.
    It, however, may be distinguished by the great number
    of leaflets, which vary from seven to thirteen, and
    even to fifteen, instead of from five to seven. The flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> are also without bracts, except in some species not
    mentioned here. These, having connivent permanent sepals,
    cannot be confounded with the preceding division;
    nor, on account of their disk, with the following. There
    is no instance of stipular prickles in the present tribe.
    The sepals are entire, or nearly so.</p>

        a fine transparent yellow, always double. Native of the
        Levant; growing to the height of from four feet to ten
        feet, and flowering in July.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sort does not flower freely, except in open, airy
    situations and trained against a wall, exposed to the
    north or east, rather than to the south. Its flower buds
    are apt to burst on one side before they expand, and, consequently,
    to become deformed; to prevent this, the
    blossom buds should be thinned, and care taken that they
    have abundance of light and air. Watering it freely in
    the flowering season is also found advantageous, and the
    shoots in general ought not to be shortened. This beautiful
    species is said to flower freely, if grafted on the musk
    cluster at eight feet or ten feet from the ground; or it
    will do well on the China rose. It is grown in great
    abundance in Italy, where its flowers produce a magnificent
    effect, from their large size, doubleness, and brilliant
    yellow color. It is one of the oldest inhabitants of our
    gardens, though the exact year of its introduction is unknown.
    &ldquo;Ludovico Berthema tells us, in 1503, that he
    saw great quantities of yellow roses at Calicut, whence it
    appears probable that both the single and double-flowered
    varieties were brought into Europe by the Turks; as
    Parkinson tells us, in a work which he dedicated to Henrietta,
    the queen of our unfortunate Charles I., that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> double yellow rose &lsquo;was first procured to be brought to
    England by Master Nicholas Lete, a worthy merchant of
    London, and a great lover of flowers, from Constantinople,
    which (as we hear) was first brought thither from
    Syria, but perished quickly, both with him, and with all
    others to whom he imparted it; yet afterward it was
    sent to Master John de Frangueville, a merchant of London,
    and a great lover of all rose plants, as well as flowers,
    from which is sprung the greatest store that is now
    flourishing in this kingdom.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><b>R. spinosissima</b>, <i>L.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Most Spiny, or Scotch Rose.</span>&mdash;Prickles
        unequal. Leaflets flat, glabrous, simply serrated.
        A dwarf, compact bush, with creeping suckers.
        Flowers small, solitary, white or blush-colored. Fruit
        ovate, or nearly round, black or dark purple. Native of
        Europe; plentiful in Britain. Shrub, one foot to two feet
        high; flowering in May and June.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Varieties.</i> A great many varieties of this rose have been
    raised, with flowers double, semi-double, white, purple,
    red, and even yellow. The first double variety was found
    in a wild state, in the neighborhood of Perth.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><b>CENTIFOLIÆ.</b>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hundred-leaved Roses.</span></p>
<p>Shrubs, all bearing bristles and prickles. Peduncles
    bracteate. Leaflets oblong or ovate, wrinkled. Disk
    thickened, closing the throat. Sepals compound. This
    division comprises the portion of the genus <i>Rosa</i> which
    has most particularly interested the lover of flowers. It
    is probable that the earliest roses of which there are any
    records of being cultivated, belonged to this section; but
    to which particular species those of Cyrene or Mount
    Panga are to be referred, it is now too late to inquire.
    The attar of Roses, which is an important article of commerce,
    is either obtained from roses belonging to this division
    indiscriminately, as in the manufactory at Florence,
    conducted by a convent of friars; or from some particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> kind, as in India. It appears, from specimens brought
    from Chizapore by Colonel Hardwicke, that <i>R. Damascena</i> is there exclusively used for obtaining the essential oil.
    The Persians also make use of a sort which Kæmpfer
    calls <i>R. Shirazensis</i>, (from its growing about Shiraz), in
    preference to others; this may be either <i>R. Damascena</i>, <i>R. Gallica</i>, or <i>R. centifolia</i>, or, perhaps, <i>R. moschata</i>.
    The species contained in the present section are all setigerous,
    by which they are distinguished from the following
    divisions; their thickened disk and divided sepals
    separate them from the preceding. To the section of
    Rubiginosæ the glanduliferous sorts approach; but the
    difference of their glands, the size of their flowers, and
    their dissimilar habit, prevent their being confounded.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><b>R. Damascena.</b>&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Damascus, or Damask Rose.</span>&mdash;Rose
        à quatre Saisons. <i>Synonyms.</i> R. Belgica, <i>Mill</i>.
        R. calendarum, <i>Munch</i>. R. bifera, <i>Poir</i>. Prickles unequal,
        the large ones falcate. Sepals reflexed. Fruit elongated.
        Native of Syria. Flowers large, white or red,
        single or double. The present species may be distinguished
        from <i>R. centifolia</i> by the greater size of the prickles,
        the greenness of the bark, the elongated fruit, and the
        long, reflexed sepals. The petals of this species, and all
        the varieties of <i>R. centifolia</i>, as well as those of other
        species, are employed indiscriminately for the purpose of
        making rose-water. A shrub, growing from two feet to
        eight feet high, and flowering in June and July.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This species is extremely beautiful, from the size and
    brilliant color of its flowers. It is asserted by some
    writers to have been brought from Damascus in Syria at
    the time of the Crusades, but there is every probability
    that it came from Italy, since it is the same as the <i>Bifera</i>,
    or the twice-bearing rose of the ancient Roman gardeners,
    and is the original type of our Remontant Roses. The
    Roman gardeners could have produced a certain autumnal
    bloom only by a sort of retarding process; for, although
    the Damask Rose will, under peculiar circumstances, bloom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> in autumn of its own accord, yet it cannot always be relied
    upon to do so. During the early period of the French
    monarchy, when none of the Remontant Roses were
    known, and this species was common, it was considered
    quite a phenomenon to see them appear naturally in winter.
    Gregory, of Tours, speaking of the year 584, says,
    &ldquo;This year many prodigies appeared, and many calamities
    afflicted the people, for roses were seen blooming in
    January, and a circle was formed around the sun.&rdquo; And
    of the year 589 he says, &ldquo;This year trees blossomed in
    autumn, and bore fruit the second time, and roses appeared
    in the ninth month.&rdquo;</p>

        but most commonly double.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This species is distinguished from <i>R. Damascena</i> by the
    sepals not being reflexed, and the flowers having their
    petals curved inwards, so as, in the double state, to give
    the flower the appearance of the heart of a cabbage,
    whence the name of the Cabbage Rose. Its fruit is either
    oblong or roundish, but never elongated. From <i>R. Gallica</i> it is distinguished by the flowers being drooping, and
    by the larger size of the prickles, with a more robust
    habit. A shrub, growing from three feet to six feet high,
    and flowering in June and July. When this rose becomes
    unthrifty from age, it is renewed by cutting off the stems
    close to the ground as soon as the flowers have fallen;
    shoots will then be produced, sufficiently vigorous to furnish
    a beautiful and abundant bloom the following spring.</p>
<p><i>Varieties.</i> Above one hundred varieties have been assigned
    to this species, and classed in three divisions:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>
<p>Var. <b>provincialis</b> includes the Provence, or Cabbage
    Roses.</p>
<p>Var. <b>muscosa</b> comprises the Moss Roses.</p>
<p>Var. <b>pomponia</b>, the Pompone Roses. According to
    Loudon, we have made this a variety of <i>R. centifolia</i>,
    although some authors assert it to have been found
    growing wild in 1735, by a gardener of Dijon, in France,
    who discovered it while cutting wood on a mountain
    near that city. Many varieties of it have been obtained,
    among which, the most singular is the little dwarf
    given in the New Du Hamel as a distinct species. It
    does not grow more than twelve or fifteen inches high,
    and frequently perishes before blossoming.</p>
<p>Var. <b>bipinnata</b>, <i>Red</i>, has bipinnate leaves.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><b>R. Gallica</b>, <i>L.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">The French, or Provence Rose.
        Red Rose.</span>&mdash;<i>Synonyms.</i> R. centifolia, <i>Mill.</i> R. sylvatica, <i>Gater.</i> R. rubra, <i>Lam.</i> R. holosericea, <i>Rossig.</i> R.

        narrow, divaricate at the tip. Leaflets, 5-7, coriaceous,
        rigid, ovate or lanceolate, deflexed. Flower bud
        ovate-globose; sepals spreading during the time of the
        flowering. Fruit, subglobose, very coriaceous. Calyx
        and peduncle more or less hispid with glanded hairs,
        somewhat viscose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A species allied to <i>R. centifolia, L.</i>, but with round
    fruit, and very coriaceous leaflets, with more numerous
    nerves, that are a little prominent, and are anastomosing.
    Native of middle Europe and Caucasus, in hedges. The
    flowers vary from red to crimson, and from single to
    double; and there is one variety with the flowers double
    white. The petals of some of the varieties of this rose
    are used in medicine, which, though not so fragrant as
    those of the Dutch hundred-leaved rose, also one of the
    varieties of this species, are preferred for their beautiful
    color and their pleasant astringency. The petals of <i>R.
    Gallica</i> are those which are principally used for making
    conserve of roses, and, when dried, for gargles: their odor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> is increased by drying. They are also used in common
    with those of <i>R. centifolia</i>, for making rose-water and
    attar of roses. This rose was called by old writers the
    Red Rose, and is supposed to have been the one assumed
    as the badge of the House of Lancaster. This, also, is
    one of the roses mentioned by Pliny; from which, he
    says, all the others have been derived. It is often confounded
    with the Damask rose.</p>
<p><i>Varieties.</i> The varieties of this species are very numerous.
    One of the most distinct is Var. <b>parvifolia</b>. (R.
    parvifolia, <i>Ehr.</i> R. Burgundiaca, <i>Rossig.</i> R. remensis, <i>Desf.</i>) <span class="smcap">The Burgundy Rose.</span>&mdash;A dwarf, compact shrub,
    with stiff, ovate acute, and sharply serrated small leaflets,
    and very double purple flowers, which are solitary, and
    have some resemblance, in form and general appearance,
    to the flower of a double-flowered Asiatic Ranunculus.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><b>VILLOSÆ.</b>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hairy Roses.</span></p>
<p>Suckers erect. Prickles straightish. Leaflets ovate or
    oblong, with diverging serratures. Sepals connivent, permanent.
    Disk thickened, closing the throat. This division
    borders equally close upon those of Caninæ and Rubiginosæ.
    From both it is distinguished by its root-suckers
    being erect and stout. The most absolute marks of difference,
    however, between this and Caninæ, exist in the
    prickles of the present section being straight, and the serratures
    of the leaves diverging. If, as is sometimes the
    case, the prickles of this tribe are falcate, the serratures
    become more diverging. The permanent sepals are another
    character by which this tribe may be known from
    Caninæ. Rubiginosæ cannot be confounded with the
    present section, on account of the unequal hooked prickles
    and glandular leaves of the species. Roughness of
    fruit and permanence of sepals are common to both.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>
    <p><b>R. alba</b>, <i>Lin.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Common White Rose.</span>&mdash;Leaflets
        oblong, glaucous, rather naked above, simply serrated.
        Prickles straightish or falcate, slender or strong, without
        bristles. Sepals pinnate, reflexed. Fruit unarmed. Native
        of Piedmont, Cochin China, Denmark, France, and
        Saxony. Flowers large, either white, or of the most
        delicate blush color, with a grateful fragrance. Fruit oblong,
        scarlet, or blood-colored. A shrub, growing from
        four feet to ten feet in height, and flowering in June and
        July.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><b>RUBIGINOSÆ.</b>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Brier Roses.</span></p>
<p>Prickles unequal, sometimes bristle-formed, rarely wanting.
    Leaflets ovate or oblong, glandular, with diverging
    serratures. Sepals permanent. Disk thickened. Root-shoots
    arched. The numerous glands on the lower surface
    of the leaves will be sufficient to prevent anything else
    being referred to this section; and although <i>R. tomentosa</i> has sometimes glandular leaves, the inequality of the
    prickles of the species of Rubiginosæ, and their red fruit,
    will clearly distinguish them. This division includes all
    the Eglantine, or Sweet-brier Roses.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><b>R. rubiginosa</b>, <i>Lin.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rusty-leaved Rose, Sweet-Brier,

        ones interspersed. Leaflets elliptical, doubly serrated,
        hairy, clothed beneath with rust-colored glands. Sepals
        pinnate, and bristly, as well as the peduncles. Fruit obovate,
        bristly toward the base. Native throughout Europe,
        and of Caucasus. In Britain, in bushy places, on a dry
        gravelly or chalky soil. Leaves sweet-scented when
        bruised, and resembling the fragrance of the Pippin Apple.
        When dried in the shade, and prepared as a tea, they
        make a healthful and pleasant beverage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This species is extensively used in Europe for the formation
    of Tea Roses, and it is estimated that two hundred
    thousand are budded annually in the vicinity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> Paris alone. The species is very vigorous, but does not
    seem to answer well in our hot sun. The change from
    its native shaded thickets and hedges is too much for
    its tall, exposed stem, and, although the stock may not
    itself die, yet the variety budded upon it will frequently
    perish in two or three years. This is doubtless
    partly owing to a want of analogy between the
    stock and the variety given it for nourishment, but that
    the former is the prominent evil is evident by the fact
    that dwarfs of the same stock, where the stem is shaded
    by the foliage, flourish much better. The Eglantine, in
    favored situations, is very long-lived. A French writer
    speaks of one in which he had counted one hundred
    and twenty concentric layers, thus making its age the
    same number of years. Another writer speaks of an
    Eglantine in Lower Saxony, whose trunk separated into
    two very strong branches, twenty-four feet high, and extending
    over a space of twenty feet. At the height of
    seven feet, one of the branches is nearly six inches, and
    the other four inches, in circumference. There is a tradition
    that it existed in the time of Louis the Pious,
    King of Germany in the ninth century. This, however,
    must evidently be received with some allowance. Flowers,
    pink. Fruit, scarlet, obovate or elliptic. A shrub,
    growing from four feet to six feet in height, and flowering
    in June and July.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><b>CANINÆ.</b>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dog Roses.</span></p>

        those of the common <i>R. multiflora</i> have much less fringe,
        and the leaves are smaller, with the leaflets much less
        rugose. The form of the blossoms and corymbs is pretty
        nearly the same in both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A plant of this variety on the gable end of R. Donald&rsquo;s
    house, in the Goldworth Nursery, in England,
    in 1826, covered above 100 square feet, and had more
    than 100 corymbs of bloom. Some of the corymbs had
    more than 50 buds in a cluster, and the whole averaged
    about 30 in each corymb, so that the amount of
    flower buds was about 3,000. The variety of color produced
    by the buds at first opening was not less astonishing
    than their number. White, light blush, deeper blush,
    light red, darker red, scarlet, and purple flowers, all appeared
    in the same corymb; and the production of these
    seven colors at once is said to be the reason why this
    plant is called the Seven Sisters Rose. This tree produced
    a shoot the same year which grew 18 feet in length in
    two or three weeks. This variety, when in a deep, free
    soil, and an airy situation, is of very vigorous growth, and
    a free flowerer; but the shoots are of a bramble-like texture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> and the plant, in consequence, is of but temporary
    duration. R. Donald&rsquo;s <i>R. Grevillei</i> died in three or four
    years.</p>

    <p><b>Var. Russelliana</b> is a variety differing considerably, in

    <p><b>Var. Boursaulti</b>, <span class="smcap">Boursault Rose</span>, is placed, in Don&rsquo;s <i>Miller</i>, under this species; though it differs more from the
        preceding variety than many species do from each other.
        It is comparatively a hard-wooded, durable rose, and valuable
        for flowering early and freely. This is a very remarkable

        very numerous, white, with the claws of the petals yellow,
        very fragrant. Lateral peduncles jointed, and, as
        well as the calyx, pilose, and almost hispid. Sepals almost
        pinnately cut, long. Fruit red, ? ovate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The branches of the Musk Rose are generally too weak
    to support, without props, its large bunches of flowers,
    which are produced in an umbel-like manner at their extremities.
    The musky odor is very perceptible, even at
    some distance from the plant, particularly in the evening,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&ldquo;When each inconstant breeze that blows<br />
        </span> <span class="i1">Steals essence from the musky rose.&rdquo;<br />
        </span> </div>
</div>
<p>It is said to be a native of Barbary; but this has been
    doubted. It is, however, found wild in Tunis, and is cultivated
    there for the sake of an essential oil, which is obtained
    from the petals by distillation. It has also been
    found wild in Spain. The first record of the musk rose
    having been cultivated in England is in <i>Hakluyt</i>, in 1582,
    who states that the musk rose was brought to England
    from Italy. It was in common cultivation in the time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> Gerard, and was formerly much valued for its musky
    fragrance, when that scent was the fashionable perfume.
    The Persian attar of roses is said to be obtained from this
    species. The musk rose does best trained against a wall,
    on account of the length and weakness of its branches;
    and Miller adds that it should always be pruned in spring,
    as in winter it will not bear the knife. It requires very
    little pruning, as the flowers are produced at the extremities
    of the shoots, which are often 10 feet or 12 feet in
    length. It flowers freely, and is well worthy of cultivation.
    This rose is thought by some to be the same as that
    of Cyrene, which Athenæus has mentioned as affording a
    delicious perfume, but of this there is no certain evidence.
    It seems to have been rare in Europe in the time of Gessner,
    the botanist, who, in a letter to Dr. Occon, dated
    Zurich, 1565, says that it was growing in a garden at
    Augsburg, and he was extremely anxious that the doctor
    should procure some of its shoots for him. Rivers mentions
    that Olivier, a French traveler, speaks of a rose tree
    at Ispahan, called the &ldquo;Chinese Rose Tree,&rdquo; fifteen feet
    high, formed by the union of several stems, each four or
    five inches in diameter. Seeds of this tree were sent to
    Paris and produced the common Musk Rose.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>
<h3>GARDEN CLASSIFICATION.</h3>
<p>The varieties of a plant are, by Botanists, designated
    by names intended to convey an idea of certain characteristics,&mdash;the
    form and consistency of the leaves, the arrangement,
    number, size, and color of the flowers, seed-vessels,
    etc. The varieties of roses, however, have so few
    distinct characteristics, that florists find it difficult to
    give any name expressive of the very slight shades of difference
    in the color or form of the flower. Fanciful names
    have therefore been chosen, indiscriminately, according to
    the taste of the grower; and we thus find classed, in
    brotherly nearness, Napoleon and Wellington, Queen
    Victoria and Louis Philippe, Othello and Wilberforce,
    with many others. Any half-dozen English or French
    rose growers may give the name of their favorite Wellington
    or Napoleon to a rose raised by each of them, and entirely
    different in form and color from the other five
    bearing the same name. Thus has arisen the great confusion
    in rose nomenclature.</p>
<p>A still greater difficulty and confusion, however, exists
    in the classification adopted by the various English and
    French rose growers. By these, classes are multiplied
    and roses placed in them without sufficient attention to
    their distinctive characters; these are subsequently
    changed to other classes, to the utter confusion of those
    who are really desirous of obtaining some knowledge of
    the respective varieties. Even Rivers, the most correct
    of them all, has in several catalogues the same rose in as
    many different classes, and his book may perhaps place
    it in another. He thus comments upon this constant
    change:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Within the last ten years, how many plants have been
    named and unnamed, classed and re-classed!&mdash;Professor
    A. placing it here, and Dr. B. placing it there! I can
    almost imagine Dame Nature laughing in her sleeve, when
    our philosophers are thus puzzled. Well, so it is, in a
    measure, with roses; a variety has often equal claims to
    two classes. First impressions have perhaps placed it in
    one, and there rival amateurs should let it remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there exists, then, this doubt of the proper class to
    which many roses belong, we think it would be better to
    drop entirely this sub-classification, and adopt some more
    general heads, under one of which every rose <i>can</i> be
    classed. It may often be difficult to ascertain whether a
    rose is a Damask, a Provence, or a Hybrid China; but
    there can be no difficulty in ascertaining whether it is
    dwarf or climbing, whether it blooms once or more in the
    year, and whether the leaves are rough as in the Remontants,
    or smooth as in the Bengals. We have therefore
    endeavored to simplify the old classification, and have
    placed all roses under three principal heads, viz:</p>
<p>I. Those that make distinct and separate periods of
    bloom throughout the season, as the Remontant Roses.</p>
<p>II. Those that bloom continually, without any temporary
    cessation, as the Bourbon, China, etc.</p>
<p>III. Those that bloom only once in the season, as the
    French and others.</p>
<p><b>Remontants.</b>&mdash;The first of these divisions includes only
    the present Damask and Hybrid Perpetuals, and for these
    we know no term so expressive as the French <i>Remontant</i>.
    &ldquo;<i>Perpetual</i>&rdquo; does not express their true character.</p>
<p><b>Everblooming Roses</b> is the name we give to those included
    under the second general head. This is divided
    into five classes:</p>
<p>1. The <b>Bourbon</b>, the varieties of which are easily known
    by their luxuriant growth, and thick, large, leathery
    leaves. These are, moreover, reasonably hardy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>
<p>2. The <b>China</b>.&mdash;This includes the present China, Tea,
    and Noisette Roses, which are now much confused, as
    there are many among the Teas which are not tea-scented,
    and among the Noisettes are those which do not bloom in
    clusters; they are, moreover, so much alike in their
    growth and habit, that it is better each should stand upon
    its own merits, and not on the characteristics of an imaginary
    class.</p>
<p>3. <b>Musk.</b>&mdash;Roses of this class are known by their rather
    rougher foliage.</p>
<p>4. <b>Macartney.</b>&mdash;The varieties of this are distinguished
    by their very rich, glossy, almost evergreen foliage.</p>
<p>5. <b>Microphylla.</b>&mdash;A class easily distinguished by their
    peculiar foliage and straggling habit.</p>
<p>The third general head we divide again into five classes:</p>
<p>1. <b>Garden Roses.</b>&mdash;This includes all the present French,
    Provence, Hybrid Provence, Hybrid China, Hybrid
    Bourbon, White, and Damask Roses, many of which, under
    the old arrangement, differ more from others in their
    own class than from many in another class.</p>
<p>2. <b>Moss Roses</b>, all of which are easily distinguished.</p>
<p>3. <b>Brier Roses</b>, which will include the Sweet-Brier,
    Hybrid Sweet-Brier, and Austrian Brier.</p>
<p>4. <b>Scotch Roses.</b></p>
<p>5. <b>Climbing Roses</b>; which are again divided into all the
    distinctive subdivisions.</p>
<p>In describing colors, we have given those which prevail.
    It is well known that many roses are very variable
    in this respect, and that the same flower will frequently
    be white or yellow, crimson or blush, at different periods
    of its bloom. We have seen a plant produce several
    flowers totally unlike each other; one being dark crimson,
    and the other pale blush. We therefore describe the <i>prevailing</i> color, and the cultivator should not be disappointed
    if his rose, the first season, should not correspond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> with the description; neither should he be disappointed
    if a rose which we describe as very double should with
    him prove very single. Transplanting will often temporarily
    change the character of roses, and they often refuse
    to develop themselves perfectly under our hot sun, or in a
    poor soil. A second season is thus often required to test
    them fairly. We have seen the fine rose, La Reine,
    semi-double, and worthless at midsummer, while at other
    seasons, and perhaps in a different location, it is fully
    equal to its reputation. It is frequently the case, that
    roses imported from Europe, under glowing descriptions,
    prove worthless the first season, but fully sustain their
    character the second. We mention these things here, in
    order that the amateur may be prepared for any temporary
    disappointment that may occur. In describing over
    two hundred choice varieties, we have endeavored to select
    those whose character is well established for superior
    and distinct qualities, and above all, for vigorous growth.
    Any variety whose growth is uniformly weak has been
    at once rejected, notwithstanding its great beauty of
    flower. Thus many fine roses, like Gloire de Santenay, are
    thrown aside. There are many equally good that have
    been necessarily omitted, and there are also new varieties
    we have recently received from Europe, which may prove
    superior to many we have named.</p>
<p>From this list, the rose amateur may feel safe in selecting,
    without incurring the risk of obtaining inferior varieties.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">ROSES THAT BLOOM DURING THE WHOLE SEASON.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sf">REMONTANT ROSES.</span></p>
<p>The term Remontant&mdash;signifying, literally, <i>to grow
    again</i>&mdash;we have chosen to designate this class of roses,
    there being no word in our own language equally expressive.
    They were formerly called Damask and Hybrid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a><br />
    <a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> Perpetuals, but are distinguished from the true Perpetual
    or Everblooming Roses by their peculiarity of distinct
    and separate periods of bloom. They bloom with the
    other roses in early summer, then cease for a while, then
    make a fresh season of bloom, and thus through the summer
    and autumn, differing entirely from the Bourbon and
    Bengal Roses, which grow and bloom continually through
    the summer. In order, therefore, to avoid confusion, we
    have deemed it best to adopt the French term, <i>Remontant</i>.</p>

    <div class="caption"> Fig. 1.&mdash;REMONTANT ROSE.</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>These roses have generally been obtained by hybridization
    between the Hybrid China and Damask, and the
    Bourbon and China Roses, uniting the luxuriant growth
    and hardy character of the former two with the ever-blooming
    qualities of the latter. They are generally
    large, double, very fragrant, and bloom, some of them,
    freely throughout the season. They are also perfectly
    hardy, and grow well in any climate without protection.
    These qualities render them very desirable, and they are
    fast driving out of cultivation the Garden Roses, which
    bloom but once, and during the rest of the season cumber
    the ground. There are, it is true, among the latter, some
    varieties, like Madame Plantier, Chénédole, Persian Yellow,
    and others, that are not equaled by any varieties existing
    among the Remontants. Such, however, is the skill now
    exerted by rose growers, that this will not long be the
    case, and we may hope soon to have among the Remontants,
    roses of every shade of color, with the snow-like
    whiteness of Madame Plantier, the golden richness of
    Persian Yellow, or the peculiar brilliancy of Chénédole.</p>

    the best.</p>
<p><b>General Jacqueminot.</b>&mdash;A strong grower, and when
    in bud, one of the most beautiful of roses. Its open
    flower, not being perfectly double, is surpassed by others.
    Its color is a scarlet crimson, with a soft velvety sheen,
    and a few thousand of them in full bloom is a sight to be
    remembered. A basket of buds freshly cut in the morning
    is sure to be appreciated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>
<p><b>La Reine.</b>&mdash;When our first edition was issued, this
    variety was unequalled. Others have now surpassed it.
    It is, however, still valuable for its glossy rose color, and
    its large, full, semi-globular form.</p>

    flower. Its color is bright shaded rosy carmine.</p>
<p><b>Louise Carique.</b>&mdash;One of the most valuable Remontants.

    foliage and habit of the Scotch roses. Its flowers are
    large, blush colored, and rather flat. It is an abundant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> and constant bloomer throughout the season, and its peculiar,
    delightful fragrance renders it very desirable.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">REMONTANT MOSS.</p>
<p><b>Blanche Moreau.</b>&mdash;Large, full, perfect form; pure
    white; buds and flowers produced in clusters and freely

<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">BOURBON ROSES.</p>
<p>This class does not possess the hardiness of the Remontants,
    nor the free blooming properties of the Bengals,
    Teas, and Noisettes, and therefore can never compete
    with the former for the North, nor with the latter for the
    South. In it, however, are varieties like Hermosa, Souvenir
    de Malmaison, and others, which are scarcely surpassed
    in any class. The Bourbon Rose has also qualities
    which make many varieties favorites. These qualities are
    its greater hardiness than the Tea Rose, its very thick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> leathery foliage, its luxuriant growth, its more constant
    bloom than the Remontants, and its thick, velvety petals,
    of a consistency to endure the summer&rsquo;s sun.</p>

    <div class="caption"> Fig. 2.&mdash;BOURBON ROSE.</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>It was introduced into France by Jacques, head gardener
    of the Duke of Orleans, at Neuilly, who received it in
    1819 from Bréon, director of the Royal gardens in the Isle
    of Bourbon. The following account of its origin is given
    by Bréon, and is also mentioned by Rivers:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Isle of Bourbon, the inhabitants generally inclose
    their land with hedges made of two rows of roses;
    one row of the common China Rose, the other of the Red
    Four Seasons. M. Perichon, a planter in the island, found
    in one of these hedges a young plant, differing very much
    from the others in its shoots and foliage. This he transplanted
    into his garden. It flowered the following year,
    and proved to be of a new race, and very different from
    the above two roses, which at that time were the only
    varieties known in the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Its resemblance to the Bengal Rose was, however, so
    strong, that it was soon considered a variety of that species.
    Its characteristics are, however, so entirely different
    from the Bengal, that we give it a separate place in our
    garden classification. To the French we owe nearly all
    the varieties of this class which have been produced from
    the original semi-double rose, or Bourbon Jacques, as it
    was called. Of these varieties, the following are distinct,
    and possess many charming qualities that cannot fail to
    gratify the amateur.</p>
<p><b>Acidalie.</b>&mdash;One of the best light roses, being sometimes
    light blush, and at others white. Its autumnal bloom is
    its best.</p>
<p><b>Appoline.</b>&mdash;A vigorous grower; its color is rose and
    pink.</p>
<p><b>Dr. Berthet.</b>&mdash;Brilliant cherry red; large, full, and
    good.</p>
<p><b>George Peabody.</b>&mdash;Medium, full, well formed; purplish
    crimson; fragrant; a moderate grower, but one of
    the best of its class.</p>
<p><b>Hermosa.</b>&mdash;An old variety, but still one of the very
    best of this group. Its form is cupped, very double and
    perfect, and no rose blooms more abundantly, either
    forced or in the open ground. Its color is delicate rose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> The plant is of medium growth, and well adapted for
    grouping or for planting in beds with Mrs. Bosanquet
    and Agrippina.</p>
<p><b>Marquise Balbiano.</b>&mdash;Rose, tinged with silver; full,
    fine form.</p>
<p><b>Perle d&rsquo;Angers.</b>&mdash;Very pale rose, almost white; large
    and full, imbricated.</p>
<p><b>Queen of the Bourbons.</b>&mdash;A very beautiful and delicate
    rose-colored variety, slightly tinged with buff. It is
    cupped, very fragrant, large, and double, and its petals
    are arranged with a beautiful regularity.</p>
<p><b>Queen of Bedders.</b>&mdash;Medium, very full; rich crimson.
    Few recent roses have been so highly praised as this; evidently
    a useful free-blooming sort.</p>
<p><b>Souvenir de la Malmaison.</b>&mdash;Altogether the most
    perfect and superb rose of this or any other class. It was
    originated by Béluze, a Frenchman. Its flowers are cupped,
    and of very perfect form, very double, with thick,
    velvety petals; they are of the largest size, often four to
    five inches in diameter, and their color delicate blush,
    with a rich tint of cream. Its large and very luxuriant
    foliage, compact habit, and flowers of exceeding beauty,
    render this one of the very finest roses known.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">CHINA.</p>
<p><b>Agrippina.</b>&mdash;Though an old rose, this is still one of
    the best and most popular of its class. As a forcing rose,
    and for an abundance of bloom, it is largely cultivated by
    bouquet venders. It is cupped, beautifully formed, and
    of a rich, brilliant crimson, with a delicate white stripe
    in the center of each petal. It is one of the most hardy
    and desirable of the old China Roses.</p>
<p><b>Cels multiflora.</b>&mdash;An abundant bloomer; its color is
    white, shaded with pink.</p>
<p><b>Daily Blush.</b>&mdash;One of the oldest China Roses, but one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> of the very best. There can be nothing more perfect than
    its half-expanded bud, of a light crimson, inclining to
    blush. It commences blooming among the earliest, and,
    if the old seed-vessels are picked off, will continue to bloom
    abundantly through the summer and autumn, even after
    severe frosts. It is one of the hardiest of the class.</p>
<p><b>Daily White.</b>&mdash;Very similar to the preceding, in everything
    but the color of its flowers, which are pure white.</p>
<p><b>Douglass.</b>&mdash;Crimson; medium size; double, fine in
    bud, and one of the best forcing sorts.</p>
<p><b>Ducher.</b>&mdash;White; medium size, fine form, full; free
    flowering; promising as a free and continuous white bedding
    rose.</p>
<p><b>Little Pet.</b>&mdash;White; small and double; a pretty miniature
    rose, and exceedingly free in blooming.</p>
<p><b>Madame Bréon.</b>&mdash;One of the very best. Its flowers
    are very large and double, beautifully cupped, and of a
    brilliant rose color. Few of the old China Roses can surpass
    it.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Bosanquet.</b>&mdash;One of the most desirable of the old
    China Roses, and there are few in any other class that are
    superior to it. Its growth is luxuriant, and its superb
    cupped, wax-like flowers are of a delicate flesh-color, and
    are produced in the greatest abundance.</p>
<p><b>Viridiflora.</b>&mdash;Green; curious.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">NOISETTE.</p>
<p><b>Aimée Vibert.</b>&mdash;One of the most beautiful of the Noisette
    or cluster-flowering roses. It blooms freely through
    the season, is tolerably hardy, and produces an abundance
    of small, snow-white flowers, in fine clusters.</p>
<p><b>Beauté de l&rsquo;Europe.</b>&mdash;Deep yellow, reverse of petals
    coppery; large, full, and of perfect shape.</p>
<p><b>Caroline de Marniesse.</b>&mdash;One of the hardiest. Its
    color is white, with a tinge of pink in the center.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Celine Forestier.</b>&mdash;A vigorous growing rose. One of
    the hardiest, and with a large, full flower. Its color is
    rich yellow.</p>
<p><b>Elise Boelle.</b>&mdash;A delicate pink shading; moderate
    grower; much esteemed.</p>
<p><b>Lamarque.</b>&mdash;A well-known and superb variety, whose
    very vigorous growth adapts it well for a pillar, or even
    for a climber, as in rich soils and favorable locations it
    will make shoots of fifteen feet in a season. When budded
    on a strong stock, few roses can surpass its large
    cupped and nearly white flowers, weighing down the
    branches.</p>
<p><b>Maréchal Niel.</b>&mdash;A vigorous growing rose, more free
    blooming than Chromatella. Its color is yellow, deepening
    at the center to a rich, golden yellow. It is, perhaps,
    the largest and most beautiful yellow rose known, and
    very fragrant.</p>
<p><b>Ophire.</b>&mdash;A medium-sized rose, of a very singular color,
    entirely different from any other rose known, being a bright
    salmon, almost saffron. It blooms in clusters, and its luxuriant
    habit would make it a good pillar rose.</p>
<p><b>Solfaterre.</b>&mdash;Another superb rose, of very much the
    same character. Its flowers are large and globular, inclining
    to flat, and their color bright lemon. When half
    opened, the buds are superb. Like Chromatella (and
    Lamarque, the parent of both), its growth is very luxuriant.
    Rivers mentions a plant which threw out a shoot
    from a single bud eighteen feet in one season, and the
    next season was covered with flower buds.</p>
<p><b>Triomphe de Rennes.</b>&mdash;A fine rose, of large, full form,
    and canary color.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">TEA ROSES.</p>
<p><b>Adam.</b>&mdash;One of the finest tea-scented roses. Its flowers
    are cupped, very double and large, and of perfect
    form.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Andre Schwartz.</b>&mdash;Crimson-scarlet, with an occasional
    white streak on the inner petal; of tea fragrance, and
    very free flowering.</p>
<p><b>Antoine Mermet.</b>&mdash;Deep rosy-carmine; large, full, and
    cupped.</p>
<p><b>Bon Silene.</b>&mdash;A very beautiful tea-scented rose, cupped,
    very double, and fragrant. Its color is rose, shaded
    with crimson, and the plant is hardy and of luxuriant
    growth.</p>
<p><b>Bougere.</b>&mdash;A very large, superb rose, one of the very
    best of the tea-scented varieties. Its form is cupped, and
    its color a rich, glossy, bronzed rose.</p>
<p><b>Caroline.</b>&mdash;A fine variety, with very double and perfect
    flowers, of a bright rose color.</p>
<p><b>Capucine.</b>&mdash;A very distinct sort, with beautiful saffron
    yellow buds. Of delicate habit.</p>
<p><b>Catharine Mermet.</b>&mdash;Large, pointed buds, full, and of
    good form; rosy flesh color; fine fragrance; moderate
    grower. Esteemed by those who force roses for the market,
    as one of the most valuable.</p>
<p><b>Clara Sylvain.</b>&mdash;One of the best white roses. It grows
    very freely, and gives its globular, pure white, and fragrant
    flowers in the greatest abundance.</p>
<p><b>Comtesse de Frigueuse.</b>&mdash;Canary yellow; fine and
    striking, large and full; free.</p>
<p><b>Cornélie Koch.</b>&mdash;White, sometimes faintly tinged with
    pale straw color. A grand rose, and a great favorite for
    forcing.</p>
<p><b>Devoniensis.</b>&mdash;A very beautiful rose, of immense size.
    Like Chromatella, it is sometimes a shy bloomer when
    young, but is well adapted for forcing. Its form is cupped,
    and its color a fine creamy white, tinted with rose.</p>
<p><b>Duc de Magenta.</b>&mdash;Has a large and fine form. Its
    color is rosy salmon, shading to pink.</p>
<p><b>Etendard de Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc.</b>&mdash;Creamy white, changing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> to pure white; very large and full, opening well; a seedling
    from <i>Gloire de Dijon</i>; very free.</p>
<p><b>General Tartas.</b>&mdash;This is of a dark rose color, and has
    a large and full form.</p>
<p><b>Gloire de Dijon.</b>&mdash;One of the finest and hardiest of the
    whole group. It is a strong grower, and makes a good
    climber. Its foliage is luxuriant, and its flowers are large
    and double; their color is pale salmon, buff, and yellow.
    This variety will always give satisfaction.</p>
<p><b>Her Majesty.</b>&mdash;Clear and bright satiny rose color;
    flowers very large and full.</p>
<p><b>Homer.</b>&mdash;A peculiar and beautiful rose when in bud.
    Its color is rose, tipped with red, and with a salmon
    center.</p>
<p><b>Isabella Sprunt.</b>&mdash;A new, yellow rose, of great merit.
    Its remarkably free blooming qualities make it a valuable
    acquisition for forcing and for cut flowers.</p>
<p><b>Jaune d&rsquo;Or.</b>&mdash;A golden yellow rose, of good form.</p>
<p><b>Julie Mansais.</b>&mdash;A large and superb tea-scented rose,
    globular, and very fragrant. Its color is white, with
    lemon.</p>
<p><b>Madame Bravy.</b>&mdash;Finely formed, and of a creamy white
    color.</p>
<p><b>Madame Chedayne Guénoisseau.</b>&mdash;Canary yellow; very
    beautiful in bud; large, full, of fine form, and very free.</p>
<p><b>Madame Cusin.</b>&mdash;Purplish rose, center slightly tinted
    with yellowish white; medium size; full and distinct.</p>
<p><b>Madame de Tartas.</b>&mdash;Large, and free blooming; of a
    bright rose color.</p>
<p><b>Madame Falcot.</b>&mdash;Buff yellow, something deeper than
    Safrano, and more double in form. One of the best.</p>
<p><b>Mademoiselle Cécile Berthod.</b>&mdash;Large, full, fine form;
    bright sulphur yellow; moderate.</p>
<p><b>Marie Berton.</b>&mdash;(Climbing.) Very large; straw color,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> rather fragrant; vigorous, with fine foliage; regarded as
    the most free bloomer of all the seedlings of <i>Gloire de
    Dijon</i>.</p>
<p><b>Marie Guillot.</b>&mdash;Large, beautiful in bud, nearly perfect
    in form; white, with a faint tinge of yellow; free, and
    one of the best of the newer light-colored varieties.</p>
<p><b>Marie Van Houtte.</b>&mdash;Excellent form; the pale-yellow
    petals, often suffused with rose; free, and highly esteemed,
    especially for cultivation in the open air.</p>
<p><b>May Paul.</b>&mdash;Red, shaded and veined with lilac; large
    and full.</p>
<p><b>Niphetos.</b>&mdash;Color almost white. When grown under
    glass, it is one of the most popular and beautiful roses.</p>
<p><b>Papa Gontier.</b>&mdash;A new red rose, of great value; fragrant;
    free blooming, and of vigorous growth.</p>
<p><b>Perle de Lyon.</b>&mdash;Large, very double, and fragrant;
    deep yellow, with a tinge of saffron at center; excellent
    fragrance; very vigorous grower, and is much used to
    train up the pillars of green-houses, where it flowers freely;
    mildews in the open air.</p>
<p><b>Perle des Jardins.</b>&mdash;Large to very large, excellent
    form, with stiff stem; deep canary yellow; exquisite tea-fragrance;
    a free grower and bloomer; the foliage is very
    dark and glaucous, and the five to seven leaflets are
    strongly serrated. This variety, both in this country and
    in Europe, proves to be a formidable rival to <i>Maréchal
    Neil</i>. It is largely forced for the New York market, and
    it is also excellent in the open ground.</p>
<p><b>Pierre Guillot.</b>&mdash;(Hybrid.)&mdash;Large, erect, well formed;
    bright red; fragrant; moderate to vigorous; free bloomer.</p>
<p><b>Puritan.</b>&mdash;A new white rose of great beauty; very
    large flower; blooming freely; good grower, and free
    bloomer; fragrant.</p>
<p><b>Reine Marie Henriette.</b>&mdash;(Climber.)&mdash;Large, good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> form, double; cerise red; rather fragrant; very vigorous;
    this is also a cross from <i>Gen. Jacqueminot</i>.</p>
<p><b>Rubens.</b>&mdash;Color rose and white, with yellow center;
    form large and double.</p>
<p><b>Safrano.</b>&mdash;This is scarcely excelled by any rose. Its
    half-opened bud is very beautiful, and of a rich, deep
    fawn color. When open, its form is poor, and its color a
    much lighter fawn. These fawn-colored roses have peculiar
    charms for us; and of them all, there are none more
    beautiful or richer than Safrano.</p>
<p><b>Sombreuil.</b>&mdash;A strong grower, with flowers of a pale
    straw color.</p>
<p><b>Souvenir d&rsquo;un Ami.</b>&mdash;The queen of the tea-scented
    roses, and will rank the very first among them. Its habit
    is good, it blooms freely, and its large and beautifully
    imbricated flowers, when open, much resemble in form
    those of Souvenir de Malmaison. Its color is a delicate
    salmon, shaded with rose, and its general character highly
    recommends it as first-rate in every respect. Hibberd
    claims to have produced flowers from this variety eleven
    to twelve inches in circumference when fully expanded.</p>
<p><b>Sunset.</b>&mdash;A sport from <i>Perle des Jardins</i>, bearing flowers
    similar to that variety in form and substance but of a
    deep apricot color; beautiful in bud, and a fine forcing

<p><b>The Bride.</b>&mdash;A very fine white tea rose; a sport from <i>Catherine Mermet</i>. The flowers are large, full, and of

<p>In the preceding list, we have given some of the best
    varieties of the Tea Rose, and trust the amateur will find
    no difficulty in making a selection. Many are pillar roses;
    and these, so trained, would be beautiful objects on a lawn,
    either singly, or in groups from three to a dozen. Where
    the height of the pillars can be gently graduated to the
    highest in the center, the effect will be very fine. Many
    of the luxuriant growing varieties can be trained upon a
    common pale fence, and will cover it with flowers and
    foliage the whole season. Straw can be easily thatched
    over to protect them from the severity of winter, or bass
    mats would be still better.</p>

<p class="center">THE POLYANTHA ROSES.</p>
<p>A distinct species of Rose (<i>Rosa polyantha</i>) was introduced
    from Japan several years ago. This is distinguished
    by having numerous very small flowers, borne in
    panicled clusters. In the hands of the French cultivators,
    it has produced what promises to be a distinct and
    popular class, of which the following are regarded as the
    best. They are probably hybrids, as they remontant,
    while the original species blooms but once. The English
    often call them &ldquo;Daisy Roses.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Anne Marie de Montravel.</b>&mdash;Small, an inch and a
    half in diameter, very double; pure white; lasts a long
    while in perfection; moderately fragrant. Jean Sisley
    writes: &ldquo;Each truss will make in itself a splendid bouquet.&rdquo;
    Dwarf, but vigorous.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>
<p><b>M&rsquo;lle. Cécile Brünner.</b>&mdash;Very small, full; fine salmon-pink;
    highly fragrant; moderate or dwarf; flowers freely.
    Obtained by crossing with a Tea.</p>
<p><b>Mignonette.</b>&mdash;Very small, double; in clusters of thirty
    or forty; rose-color, changing to blush.</p>
<p><b>Paquerette.</b>&mdash;Fine form, full, only an inch in diameter;
    pure white; growth moderate.</p>
<p><b>Perle d&rsquo;Or.</b>&mdash;Nankeen yellow, with orange centres;
    small and full, very beautiful; flowers very numerous
    and of good shape.</p>
<p><b>Princesse Wilhelmine des Pays Bas.</b>&mdash;Pure white, imbricated,
    very sweet.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">THE RAMANAS ROSE (<i>Rosa rugosa</i>).</p>
<p>Since the last edition was published this Rose has been
    introduced into cultivation and has become deservedly popular.
    The plant is very vigorous, growing large clumps five
    or six feet in height with exceedingly thorny stems. The
    foliage is remarkably robust, very dark-green, strongly-veined,
    and of great substance; it is rarely attacked by
    insects. The rose-colored, or white single flowers, about
    three inches across, are borne in large clusters, and have
    a most delightful fragrance. They continue in bloom
    for a long time, and are succeeded by large fruits (heps)
    of a bright-red color, which make the bush very showy
    in autumn. There are in cultivation a white and a
    rose-colored variety. A double variety has been introduced,
    but it is only partially double, and not preferable
    to the single. These are most valuable roses for the
    shrubbery, suckering somewhat, but not to an annoying
    extent.</p>
<p>This species was sent to this country from Japan by
    Mr. Thomas Hogg, about fifteen years ago; it was also
    introduced into Europe by others. It has been described
    in French and other journals as <i>Rosa Regeliana</i> and <i>R.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span><i> Fortunei</i>, but the much older name <i>R. rugosa</i> must
    supersede these. The adoption of the Japanese &ldquo;<i>Ramanas</i>&rdquo;
    will avoid any confusion as to botanical names.
    Whether a species so very distinct as this will yield itself
    to the efforts of the hybridizer remains to be seen, but it
    offers a most tempting subject. Could the vigorous, almost
    leathery foliage, thorough hardiness and powerful
    fragrance of this be combined with the handsome form
    and varied tints of roses of the popular classes, it would
    be a great horticultural achievement. The European
    journals mention that a new variety of this species was
    exhibited at Lyons this year, but no description is given.
    It is however interesting to know that the skilled rose
    growers of the south of France have taken it in hand.</p>
<p>The Japanese have long held the Ramanas Rose in high
    favor. It is recorded that as early as the year 1100, of
    our era, the court-ladies prepared a favorite perfume
    from its petals; but it is also stated that they had the
    bad taste to add to it both camphor and musk.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">MACARTNEY ROSES.</p>
<p>The Macartney rose was brought from China to England
    by Lord Macartney, in 1793. Its habit is luxuriant,
    and its foliage is more beautiful than that of any other
    rose, its leaves being thick, and of a rich, glossy green.
    It commences blooming about midsummer, and its flowers,
    with a fragrance like the perfume of an apricot, succeed
    each other without interruption till the first frosts,
    while the leaves remain till the very latest. Although as
    hardy as the hardiest of the China Roses, it would be better
    in this latitude to give it the same protection as recommended
    for the China. It is one of the most desirable
    roses for beds or borders. When covering the whole
    ground, and kept well pegged down, its rich, glossy foliage,
    gemmed with fragrant flowers, produces a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> effect. The varieties of this rose are very few, but the
    best two are the following:</p>
<p><b>Alba odorata.</b>&mdash;A vigorous growing rose, with very
    rich and beautiful foliage. Its fragrant flowers are cream-colored,
    and, when in bud, are very beautiful. It has
    stood the last three winters uninjured in our grounds,
    without protection, and is a very beautiful and desirable
    variety. It is classed by Rivers as a Microphylla, but it
    so little resembles that rose, and is so decidedly Macartney
    in its character, that we place it with the latter.</p>
<p><b>Maria Leonida.</b>&mdash;A very beautiful, but not entirely
    double variety, as its stamens can sometimes be seen,
    which, however, give a graceful appearance. Its flowers
    are finely cupped, and pure white, with a tinge of blush
    at the base of the petals.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">MICROPHYLLA ROSES.</p>
<p>This species, originally from the Himalayan Mountains,
    was first brought to Europe in 1823. Its foliage is small
    and singular, and its growth is very robust. Its flowers
    bloom from midsummer till frost, and have a striking appearance;
    they are very double, with a calyx of which
    the small, bristling sepals give the opening bud the appearance
    of a small chestnut. The plant is hardy, and
    has endured the winter in our grounds for the past twenty
    years without protection, losing only a portion of the tops
    of its shoots. Of the several varieties, one of the best is</p>
<p><b>Rubra</b>, which has very double and cupped flowers, of
    a blush and often rose color, with a deep red centre.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">MUSK ROSES.</p>
<p>The Musk Rose grows naturally in Persia and other
    Eastern countries, where it attains the height of a small
    tree, and is doubtless the rose which has been celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> by Eastern poets. It is also found in India, where it is
    probably the species used for making attar. In this latitude
    it is quite hardy, and we have a plant of the old
    White Musk in our grounds, that has braved the severity
    of more than twenty winters. It has made in one season
    shoots more than six feet long, and in our Southern
    States, more than double the growth would probably be
    obtained. The blossoms appear in clusters, and commencing
    later than any other rose, continue abundant throughout
    the season. The Old White Cluster has been widely
    distributed throughout the country, and is deservedly a
    favorite. The best two varieties, however, are the following:</p>
<p><b>Eponine.</b>&mdash;A cupped and very double variety, with the
    peculiar musk fragrance. It is pure white, and a very
    pretty rose.</p>
<p><b>Princess of Nassau.</b>&mdash;A luxuriant growing and very
    fragrant variety, and would make a good pillar rose. It
    blooms in large clusters of cupped flowers, changing from
    yellow to cream color as they open.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">ROSES THAT BLOOM ONLY ONCE IN THE SEASON.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">GARDEN ROSES.</p>
<p>For want of a better, we use this term to designate all
    those roses that bloom only once in the season, and that
    strongly resemble each other in habit and flower. It includes
    those classes called, by rose-growers, French, Provence,
    Hybrid Provence, Hybrid China, Hybrid Bourbon,
    White and Damask Roses.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 404px;"> <img src="images/i053.jpg" width="404" height="600" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"> Fig. 4.&mdash;GARDEN ROSE.</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>On a preceding page, we have given our opinion respecting
    classification, but we wish it to be fully understood,
    that we do not deny the existence of clearly distinctive
    characters in the true French, Provence, Damask,
    etc., but simply assert that the lines of difference between<span
class="pagenum" style="position: absolute; left: 860px; top: 23706px"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> these so run into each other, and are so blended together,
    that it is almost impossible to know where to place a new
    rose, which may partake of the qualities of all. We have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> mentioned Rivers as the most skillful and correct of rose-growers;
    and yet, in classing Lady Fitzgerald and Madame
    Hardy among the Damasks, he says that neither of
    them are pure Damask; and the Duke of Cambridge,
    which at first he thought a Hybrid China, he now places
    as a Damask; other similar instances are frequent. Many
    roses, moreover, are classed as hybrids which are not truly
    such. We are quite inclined to think that a large number
    of the varieties supposed to have been produced by hybridizing
    are nothing more than the natural produce, and
    that the pollen, in many cases, has not impregnated the
    pistil to which it was applied. With this uncertainty,
    therefore, as evinced by Rivers in his work, and with
    doubts of the hybridity of supposed hybrids, we deem it
    better to class them all together; and, for the benefit of
    those who may prefer the old classification, to attach to
    each name the class by which it has been hitherto known.</p>
<p>We write principally for the amateur, and we think he
    will find it less embarrassing to make a selection from this
    classification than from the old one.</p>
<p>A great number of Garden Roses exist, but we describe
    here only a few distinct varieties, with colors which are
    seldom found among the Remontants.</p>
<p>All the others have either their equals or their superiors
    among the Remontants, and being certain to bloom only
    once in the season, are scarcely worthy of cultivation,
    compared with the Remontants.</p>
<p><b>Chénédole, H. C.</b>&mdash;One of the most splendid varieties,
    and is truly beautiful. Its foliage and habit are very
    good, and its very luxuriant growth makes it a good pillar
    rose. Its flower is cupped, large, double, and fragrant,
    and its color is a rich, glowing crimson, of almost dazzling
    brilliancy. It is altogether the most desirable rose of this
    class.</p>
<p><b>Charles Lawson, H. B.</b>&mdash;This has handsome foliage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> and vigorous habit of growth, with large, symmetrical,
    and bright rose-colored flowers.</p>
<p><b>Coupe d&rsquo;Hébé, H. B.</b>&mdash;A gem of the family. It is large,
    double, symmetrical, and finely cupped. Its color a delicate,
    wax-like, rosy pink. Its growth is luxuriant, and
    adapted for pillars.</p>
<p><b>Emerance, H. P.</b>&mdash;A beautiful cupped rose, of a color
    unusual in this class, being of a pale lemon or straw
    color. Its form is very regular, and the habit of the plant
    good.</p>
<p><b>George the Fourth, H. C.</b>&mdash;An old rose, produced by
    T. Rivers, but is still one of the most desirable of this
    class. Its flowers are of a dark crimson, and its young
    shoots have a purple tinge. Its very luxuriant habit
    makes it suitable for a pillar.</p>
<p><b>Julie d&rsquo;Etranges, F.</b>&mdash;This has a large cupped flower,
    of a delicate rose color.</p>
<p><b>Madame Hardy, F.</b>&mdash;A vigorous habit, and finely shaped
    flower. Its color is pure white, sometimes with a green
    centre.</p>
<p><b>Madame Plantier, H. C.</b>&mdash;A cupped and double pure
    white rose. It is a luxuriant grower, a most abundant
    bloomer, and one of the very best of the white summer
    roses. Its foliage is so marked in its richness and beauty
    that any one can readily distinguish it by that alone.
    Were it Remontant, it would possess all the requisites of
    a perfect white rose.</p>
<p><b>Obscurité, F.</b>&mdash;One of the darkest roses known.</p>
<p><b>&#338;illet Parfait, F.</b>&mdash;A beautiful striped rose, resembling
    a carnation. Its form is compact, and its color a very
    light blush, nearly white, beautifully and distinctly striped
    with rose and bright crimson.</p>
<p><b>Tricolor de Flandre, F.</b>&mdash;A very double, distinct, and
    compact flower. Its color is lilac, striped with red and
    crimson.</p>

<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">MOSS ROSES.</p>
<p>The Moss Rose was introduced into England from Holland
    in the sixteenth century, and is first mentioned by
    Miller, in 1727, by whom it was supposed to be a sport of
    the Provence Rose, which opinion has been confirmed by
    modern botanists. Its peculiarities are the delicate prickles
    which crowd its stem, and the beautiful mossy covering
    of its calyx. This mossy appearance has been deemed
    by some a mere <i>lusus naturæ</i>, and by others the work of
    an insect similar to that which produces the bédéguar, or
    rose-gall. The former opinion, however, prevails; and
    this freak of nature cultivators have succeeded in fixing
    and perpetuating in a great number of varieties. The
    first Moss Rose known in France was said to have been
    introduced there by Madame de Genlis, who brought it
    with her on her return from England. In 1810, scarcely
    more than one variety was known, and now there exist
    more than a hundred. Of these, the best and most distinct
    are the following:</p>
<p><b>Alice Leroy.</b>&mdash;Light rosy-pink, free blooming, and of
    good habit.</p>
<p><b>Baronne de Wassenaer.</b>&mdash;This has a good form, bright
    red color, and flowers in clusters.</p>
<p><b>Captain Ingram.</b>&mdash;Flowers of a dark, velvety purple.</p>
<p><b>Comtesse de Murinais.</b>&mdash;A vigorous habit. Its color is
    pale flesh, changing to pure white, and it is one of the
    best of the white Mosses.</p>
<p><b>Common.</b>&mdash;This is the old rose-colored Moss, which
    has been generally cultivated in gardens. It grows well,
    blooms freely, is well covered with moss, and is one of
    the best of the old varieties.</p>
<p><b>Cristata.</b>&mdash;A very singular and beautiful variety, said
    to have been discovered in the crevice of a wall at Friburg,
    in Switzerland. Rivers classes it with the Provence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> Roses, and when open, it is merely a variety of that rose;
    but when in bud, it is more properly a Moss, although its
    calyx is not covered with a fine moss, but has more of a
    crested appearance. In a rich soil this fringe-like crest
    most beautifully clasps and surmounts the bud, and gives
    the rich clusters a truly elegant appearance. Its form is
    globular, and its color rose. It is one of the few that do
    not grow well on their own roots, but require to be budded
    on some strong-growing stock.</p>
<p><b>Etna.</b>&mdash;Brilliant crimson, tinted with purple.</p>
<p><b>Eugene Verdier.</b>&mdash;Light red, deeper in the center,
    large, full, and of fine form.</p>
<p><b>Gloire des Mousseuses.</b>&mdash;A large and handsome flower,
    with a clear, pale rose color.</p>
<p><b>John Cranston.</b>&mdash;Crimson and purple shaded, of medium
    size, full.</p>
<p><b>Louis Gimard.</b>&mdash;Bright red, large and full, vigorous.</p>
<p><b>Little Gem.</b>&mdash;A miniature Moss Rose, forming compact
    bushes densely covered with small double crimson
    flowers, beautifully mossed. It is of charming effect in
    the garden and most valuable for bouquets or vases.</p>
<p><b>Laneii.</b>&mdash;A vigorous grower, and has large and thrifty
    foliage. The buds are large and well mossed, and it is
    beautiful both in bud and expanded. Its color is bright
    rose.</p>
<p><b>Luxembourg.</b>&mdash;Like the last, of vigorous growth. Its
    flowers are a purplish crimson.</p>
<p><b>Madame de Rochelambert.</b>&mdash;This has large and full
    flowers, of an amaranth color.</p>
<p><b>Madame Edouard Ory.</b>&mdash;This was described among
    the Remontant Mosses.</p>
<p><b>Nuits de Young.</b>&mdash;Plant of a dwarf habit. Its flowers
    are small, with a deep, velvety purple color.</p>
<p><b>Princesse Adelaide.</b>&mdash;A remarkably vigorous-growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> variety, with large and handsome foliage, and would
    make a good pillar rose. Its regularly formed flowers,
    of a bright pink or rose, are produced in clusters, and
    open well. It does not bear close pruning. This is one
    of the most desirable of its class, and owes its origin to
    Laffay.</p>
<p><b>Princess Royal.</b>&mdash;A very robust rose, almost equal to
    the preceding in vigor. Its young leaves and branches
    have a red tinge, and its cupped flowers are of a deep
    crimson purple, marbled and spotted with red. Although
    not quite double when fully open, they are very beautiful
    when in bud. A moss rose, however double, is peculiar
    only in bud, for, when fully expanded, the mossy calyx
    must inevitably be hidden.</p>
<p><b>Perpetual White.</b>&mdash;This was described among the Remontant
    Mosses, as also were</p>
<p><b>Reine Blanche.</b>&mdash;Pure white, large and full.</p>
<p><b>Salet.</b></p>
<p><b>White Bath.</b>&mdash;Paper-white, beautiful, large and full,
    one of the best.</p>
<p>Like all other roses, and even in a greater degree, the
    Moss Rose requires a light and very rich soil, with a dry
    bottom. Many of them make very beautiful beds and
    patches, when planted in rich soil, and kept well pegged
    down. A good supply of stable manure should be given
    them in the autumn, to be washed down about their roots
    by the winter rains. They do not generally require or
    bear so much pruning as other roses, but their bloom
    may sometimes be prolonged by shortening part of the
    shoots close, and only the tips of the remainder. When
    properly cultivated, few objects can be more beautiful
    than these roses, either singly or in masses. Without
    making so brilliant a show as some other classes, the moss
    which envelops them imparts a touch of graceful beauty
    belonging to no other flower.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">SCOTCH ROSES.</p>
<p>These roses are all derived from a dwarf rose found
    growing wild in Scotland and in the north of England.
    They are distinguished by their small leaves, abundant
    bloom, and delicate habit. Being perfectly hardy, they
    are desirable for beds or borders, in which, with proper
    arrangement of colors, they show beautifully, sometimes
    two weeks before other roses open, producing flowers
    all along the stem. Rose growers describe, in their catalogues,
    two or three hundred varieties, but of them all,
    scarcely forty or fifty are distinct; of these the best three
    are the following:</p>
<p><b>Countess of Glasgow.</b>&mdash;A very pretty and brilliant dark
    rose, blooming abundantly.</p>
<p><b>Queen Of May.</b>&mdash;A fine and distinct variety, of a bright
    pink color.</p>
<p><b>William the Fourth.</b>&mdash;An excellent variety, of luxuriant
    growth. Its flowers are pure white, and among the
    largest of the class.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">BRIER ROSES.</p>
<p>These roses are distinguished by their small, rough foliage
    and brier habit. They include the Sweet-Brier, the
    Hybrid Sweet-Brier, and the Austrian Brier. The Sweet-Brier
    is found in various parts of this country and in Europe,
    and is distinguished by the peculiar delightful fragrance
    of its leaves. Its simple little flower, found among
    the hedges, has been long a favorite, and, under the name
    of Eglantine, has been often the theme of poets.</p>
<p>The Hybrid Sweet-Brier is allied to the preceding, but
    has larger foliage, and is of more robust growth. Many
    roses have been placed in this class and among the Sweet-Briers
    that have none of the peculiar scent of the Sweet-Briers;
    and hence, again, the necessity of classing together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> these and the Austrian Briers, respecting which there
    is much confusion. The true Austrian Rose is a native
    of the South of Europe, and is a clearly distinct rose; but
    some have been called Austrian which have scarcely any
    of the characters of the original rose. All three, however,
    are Briers, that is, they produce their flowers on
    short joints all along the stem, and have the peculiar rough,
    briery leaves. We therefore place them all together, attaching
    as before the name of the old class. The best are
    the following:</p>
<p><b>Celestial, S. B.</b>&mdash;A small cupped rose, very double and
    fragrant, of a pale flesh-color and very pretty.</p>
<p><b>Copper Austrian, A. B.</b>&mdash;A very singular looking rose,
    blooming well in this climate. The inside of the flower
    is of a coppery-red, and the outside inclining to pale yellow
    or sulphur. It is desirable for its peculiar color.</p>
<p><b>Double Margined Hip, H. S. B.</b>&mdash;Of luxuriant growth,
    almost adapted for a pillar. Its form is cupped, and its
    color creamy-white, shaded with pink.</p>
<p><b>Double Yellow Provence</b> is the best of the two varieties
    which compose the species called Sulphurea. We
    have never seen its flowers, and English writers all speak
    of the great difficulty of making it bloom. Rivers recommends
    to bud it on strong stocks, and says that it
    blooms most profusely in the warm, dry climate of Florence
    and Genoa. The plant grows with luxuriance and
    produces plenty of flower-buds, which, with proper culture,
    would probably open in our warm climate, which is very
    similar to that of Florence and Genoa. Its small foliage
    and slender, thorny wood, place it fairly among the Briers.
    Its flower is so fine that it is well worth the trouble
    of repeated experiment to obtain a good bloom. It has
    long been admired and exercised the skill of rose growers,
    as is proved by the following passages from some old
    works, which give instructions for proper culture:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereas all other roses are best natural, this is best
    inoculated upon another stock. Others thrive and bear
    best in the sun; this, in the shade: therefore the best way
    that I know to cause this rose to bring forth fair and
    kindly flowers, is performed after this manner. First in
    the stock of a Francfort Rose, near the ground, put in the
    bud of the single yellow rose, which will quickly shoot to
    a good length; then, half a yard higher than the place
    where the same was budded, put into it a bud of the
    double yellow rose, which growing, the suckers must be
    kept from the root, and all the buds rubbed off, except
    those of the kind desired, which, being grown big enough
    to bear (which will be in two years), it must in winter be
    pruned very near, cutting off all the small shoots, and
    only leaving the biggest, cutting off the tops of them
    also, as far as they are small. Then in the spring, when
    the buds for leaves come forth, rub off the smallest of
    them, leaving only some few of the biggest, which, by
    reason of the strength of the stock, affordeth more nourishment
    than any other, and the agreeable nature of the
    single yellow rose, from whence it is immediately nourished,
    the shoots will be strong and able to bear out the
    flowers, if they be not too many, which may be prevented
    by nipping off the smallest buds for flowers. The tree
    should stand something shadowed, and not too much in
    the heat of the sun, and in a standard by itself, rather
    than under a wall.&rdquo; That which follows is from a book
    called <i>Systema Horticulturæ</i>, dated 1688:&mdash;&ldquo;There is no
    flower-bearing tree that yields blossom so beautiful as the
    rose, whereof the yellow Provence Rose is the most beautiful
    where it brings forth fair and kindly flowers, which
    hath been obtained by budding a single yellow rose on the
    stock of a flourishing Francfort Rose near the ground:
    when that single yellow is well grown, in that branch inoculate
    your double yellow rose; then cut off all suckers and
    shoots from the first and second, leaving only your last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> which must be pruned very near, leaving but few buds,
    which will have the more nourishment, and yield the
    fairer and more entire blossoms. This tree, or a layer
    from a rose of the same kind, delights most, and blows
    fairest, in a cold, moist, and shady place, and not against
    a hot wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Harrisonii.</b>&mdash;A fine yellow Brier of American origin,
    and is perhaps the best hardy yellow rose for general cultivation.</p>
<p><b>Persian Yellow, A. B.</b>&mdash;This is the deepest yellow rose
    known, and is a highly improved edition of the Harrison.
    Its flowers are more double, and of a deeper yellow
    than that rose. It grows freely, blooms abundantly, and
    its small double flowers possess a richness of color unequalled
    by any other rose. No garden should be without
    it. It should be added, however, that it is exceedingly
    difficult to strike from cuttings, and is one of those few
    varieties for which budding upon another stock is preferable.</p>
<p><b>Rose Angle, S. B.</b>&mdash;An excellent variety, with very
    fragrant foliage, and large double flowers of a bright rose
    color. It is one of the best of the true Eglantines.</p>
<p>Like the Moss Roses, the Briers will not bear much
    pruning, and require merely the tips of the shoots to be
    cut off.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">AYRSHIRE ROSES.</p>
<p>This class is very valuable for covering unsightly places,
    old buildings, and decayed trees. They bloom some two
    weeks earlier than other roses, and will grow in soil where
    others would scarcely vegetate. Hence they are valuable
    for covering naked sand-banks, or bare spots of earth, and
    their roots would be of material assistance in keeping up
    the soil of loose banks. Rivers gives an extract from the
    Dundee Courier, showing the effect produced by some of
    these roses.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Some years ago, a sand pit at Ellangowan was filled
    up with rubbish found in digging a well. Over this a
    piece of rock was formed for the growth of plants which
    prefer such situations, and among them were planted some
    half dozen plants of the Double Ayrshire Rose, raised in this
    neighborhood about ten years ago. These roses now most
    completely cover the whole ground, a space of thirty feet
    by twenty. At present they are in full bloom, showing
    probably not less than ten thousand roses in this small
    space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ayrshire Roses are also valuable for weeping trees;
    when budded on a stock some ten or twelve feet high, the
    branches quickly reach the ground, and protecting the
    stem from the sun by their close foliage, present a weeping
    tree of great beauty, loaded with flowers.</p>
<p><b>Dundee Rambler.</b>&mdash;One of the best and most double
    of the Ayrshire Roses. Its color is white, often edged
    with pink, and blooming in large clusters. It is a very
    desirable variety.</p>
<p><b>Double Blush Ayrshire.</b>&mdash;A most vigorous climber,
    with a pretty flower, and will grow in the poorest soil.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">BANKSIAN ROSES.</p>
<p>Roses of this class have a very small flower closely resembling
    that of the double <i>Spiræa prunifolia</i>, and
    blooming in clusters of about the same size. In this
    climate they require the protection of a green-house, and
    are very striking for the great profusion of their corymbs
    of pure white or deep yellow flowers. We recollect seeing,
    at the Botanic Garden at Naples, a very large plant
    of the Banksian Rose, the main stem being six inches in
    diameter, and branching off into a dozen others, fifty feet
    or more long. In the Southern States they would grow
    well in the open air, and being most vigorous climbers,
    would soon cover a house or trellis, and, with their small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> but most abundant flowers interspersed among the smooth
    glossy-green foliage, would form an object of great beauty.</p>
<p><b>Double White.</b>&mdash;Introduced into England from China
    in 1807, and named in honor of Lady Banks. It is a
    beautiful little rose about half an inch in diameter, blooming
    abundantly in small and pure white clusters with a
    slight perfume like that of the violet.</p>
<p><b>Double Yellow.</b>&mdash;Introduced in 1827. It has bright
    buff-yellow flowers; these are produced in great abundance,
    and give a pleasant perfume before the dew is off
    early in the morning, or just at evening.</p>
<p><b>Fortuniana.</b>&mdash;Introduced by Fortune in 1850. It has
    white fragrant flowers of much larger size than the preceding
    varieties. Its want of the <i>petite</i> character of the
    others makes it less beautiful and striking.</p>
<p><b>Jaune Serin.</b>&mdash;A luxuriant growing variety, with yellow
    flowers of larger size than those of the old Yellow
    Banksia.</p>
<p>The Banksian Roses do not bear much pruning. It
    should be done immediately after the bloom is over, and
    then only the heavier branches cut out, leaving those
    which are full flower-bearing twigs, which should not
    be shortened. If the branches are all shortened, the
    plants will produce an abundance of strong, new wood,
    but no flowers.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">BOURSAULT ROSES.</p>
<p>This class is marked by its long, flexible, reddish shoots,
    which grow rapidly, and are perfectly hardy. Their
    smooth bark renders them desirable for stocks to bud upon,
    and a fine rose of this class, covering a trellis and budded
    with roses of various colors, would present a beautiful
    appearance. These, also, are impatient of much
    pruning.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Amadis.</b>&mdash;One of the best, with its pendulous clusters
    of large purplish-crimson flowers.</p>
<p><b>Blush.</b>&mdash;This has large, double, blush flowers.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">EVERGREEN ROSES.</p>
<p>The original of this class is the <i>Rosa sempervirens</i>, a
    wild rose of Italy. They are very beautiful and desirable,
    and although not entirely evergreen in this climate, retain
    their foliage very late in the season. They are very easy
    of cultivation, and most luxuriant climbers over naked
    trees, old houses, fences, and walls, or along the surface of
    the ground, which they will soon cover to the exclusion
    of all weeds, and present a large mass of rich, glossy foliage,
    and abundant bloom. When thus planted, the large
    weeds should be pulled up until the plant fairly covers
    the ground, when no more attention will be needed. They
    are well adapted for training up columns, and we know
    of few things more beautiful than a temple formed of
    numerous columns, with Evergreen Roses growing luxuriantly
    upon them and festooned gracefully between.
    Nothing, indeed, can be more gracefully beautiful than
    festoons, wherever they can be made. They constitute
    the chief beauty of the vine-clad fields of Italy, and there
    would be no less beauty in occasional festooning of roses
    trained between pillars or the trees of a lawn. They are
    also very beautiful when budded on high standards, their
    dark-green glossy foliage weeping to the ground, and
    forming a fine dome or pyramid of leaf and bloom. When
    pruned in the winter, the branches may be thinned out,
    but not shortened; for if pruned close, they will make a
    luxuriant growth the next season, but will produce no
    flowers.</p>
<p><b>Félicité Perpetuelle.</b>&mdash;A most beautiful rose, and one
    of the very best of the class; when properly cultivated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> it produces an abundance of very double creamy-white
    flowers, shaped like a double ranunculus.</p>
<p><b>Melanie de Montjoie.</b>&mdash;A variety of much beauty. Its
    abundant and glossy dark-green foliage contrasts beautifully
    with its large, pure white flowers.</p>
<p><b>Myrianthes.</b>&mdash;One of the best of this class. Its flowers
    are perfectly shaped, and of a very delicate rose color.</p>
<p><b>Triomphe de Bollwiller.</b>&mdash;A very fine hybrid between
    the Evergreen and Tea Roses. It is rather tender in this
    climate, but valuable for its tendency to bloom in the autumn.
    Its flowers are very large, double, fragrant, and
    globular, and their color is a blush or creamy white. At
    the South, where it would not be killed by the cold weather,
    this would be one of the most desirable climbing roses.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">HYBRID CLIMBING ROSES.</p>
<p>We include here some which do not belong to any of the
    distinct classes.</p>
<p><b>Indica Major.</b>&mdash;A hybrid climbing rose, of most luxuriant
    growth and nearly evergreen foliage. Its flowers
    are very large, double, and of a delicate rose color. The
    very rapid growth of this rose makes it excellent for covering
    old buildings. We recollect being shown, at the
    Bartram garden of Philadelphia, a fine old plant which
    had covered the whole side of the house, and presented a
    beautiful appearance. Buist states it to be this variety.</p>
<p><b>Madame d&rsquo;Arblay</b> is a truly gigantic hybrid climber,
    perfectly hardy, and with strong, Bourbon-like foliage. It
    blooms in large clusters of pure white flowers, and is a
    truly excellent variety.</p>
<p><b>Menoux.</b>&mdash;This variety has crimson flowers, a color
    which is not common among climbing roses.</p>
<p><b>Sir John Sebright.</b>&mdash;A hybrid Musk rose, grown by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> Rivers. Its flowers are produced in large clusters, are
    very fragrant, and their color is a bright crimson-scarlet.</p>
<p><b>The Garland.</b>&mdash;A most vigorous hybrid climber, blooming
    in immense clusters of fragrant, creamy-white flowers,
    changing to blush after expansion. When in full bloom,
    the contrast of the large white clusters with the bright
    green foliage is very beautiful.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">MULTIFLORA ROSES.</p>
<p>The parent of this class is a native of China and Japan.
    They are unfortunately somewhat tender in this climate.
    We have known them to endure safely several winters
    when unprotected, but they are unreliable in this respect.
    One of the best is</p>
<p><b>Grevillei or Seven Sisters.</b>&mdash;It has a remarkably vigorous
    growth, and blooms with unusual profusion. A
    large plant will not unfrequently show more than a thousand
    flowers, all blooming in clusters and of several shades
    of color. This variety is impatient of much pruning.</p>
<p><b>De la Grifferaie.</b>&mdash;This bears the knife better than the
    preceding, and may be grown as a bush with proper
    pruning. It is hardier than others of the class, and bears
    a profusion of blush and rose-colored flowers.</p>
<p><b>Laure Davoust.</b>&mdash;One of the most beautiful of the
    Multiflora Roses, and of most luxuriant growth. It has
    larger flowers and handsomer foliage than any of the other
    Multiflora Roses, and blooms in immense clusters of perfect
    flowers, changing from white to pink. For covering
    houses or trellises it is very desirable.</p>
<p><b>Russelliana.</b>&mdash;This is very vigorous, and yet bears
    pruning so well that it may be grown as a bush. Its
    clusters are large, and the flowers change as they open
    from dark to light red lilac, giving it a singular appearance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">THE PRAIRIE ROSE.</p>
<p>The double varieties of the original Michigan Rose, or <i>Rosa rubifolia</i>, have nearly all been produced by Samuel
    Feast, of Baltimore, while a few new varieties owe their
    origin to Joshua Pierce, of Washington. They are remarkable
    for their perfectly hardy nature, braving equally
    well the frosts of Canada or the heat of Louisiana. The
    leaves are large, rather rough, and of a rich dark-green.
    They grow with unexampled rapidity, exceeding in this
    respect any of the climbing roses, and would cover old
    buildings or naked ground in a very short space of time.
    They bloom after the other summer roses are mostly gone,
    and produce their flowers abundantly in large clusters of
    different shades, from the shaded white of Baltimore
    Belle to the rich deep rose of</p>
<p><b>Queen of the Prairies.</b>&mdash;This is the best, and of the
    most luxuriant growth. Its large flowers are of a peculiar
    cupped form, almost globular, when in bud, and altogether
    of very perfect shape. They are of a deep rose color, with
    a white stripe in the centre of each petal. This rose is
    truly superb, and, for our cold winters and hot sun, an
    unequalled climber. It would be a fine rose to cover a
    trellis or building, and then bud into its branches a dozen
    different Remontant or Bourbon Roses of various colors.
    The <i>tout ensemble</i> would be superb.</p>
<p><b>Baltimore Belle.</b>&mdash;This variety is thought by some to
    have a strain of Noisette sap in it from the delicacy and
    beauty of its flower and its tendency to bloom in the autumn.
    It produces abundant clusters of white flowers
    shaded with a slight cloud of pink. It is one of the finest
    climbing roses known.</p>
<p><b>Gem of the Prairie.</b> (Burgess&rsquo;.)&mdash;A hybrid between
    the Queen of the Prairies and the Remontant, Madame
    Laffay. It is said to combine the vigorous growth of the
    one with the rich color and delicate fragrance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> other. We do not, however, think that it equals its
    early promise.</p>
<p><b>Jane.</b>&mdash;Very double, of a deep rosy lilac.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Hovey.</b>&mdash;This has large white flowers, and all the
    vigor of its class.</p>
<p><b>Pride of Washington.</b>&mdash;A rosy lilac, and double.</p>
<p>There are several other varieties in this class, but the
    preceding are the best.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>
<h3>GENERAL CULTURE OF THE ROSE.</h3>
<p>As before stated, the Rose was the theme of the earliest
    poets of antiquity; and it was doubtless one of the
    first plants selected to adorn the gardens which were laid
    out around the new habitations constructed upon the exchange
    of the wandering for a civilized mode of life.</p>
<p>The most ancient authors upon husbandry, whose works
    are extant, have all treated of the culture of Roses: Theophrastus
    among the Greeks; and among the Romans,
    Varro, Columella, Palladius, and Pliny. To Pliny are we
    specially indebted for information on this subject, as the
    entire fourth chapter of the twentieth book of his Natural
    History is devoted to Roses; and they are also occasionally
    mentioned in other parts of the work. But after
    all the information thus obtained, much yet remains to be
    desired; and although we find in other ancient authors
    some curious facts bearing upon other points in the history
    of the Rose, they are mostly so general in their
    character as to give us very little insight into the actual
    culture of the Rose at those periods.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>
<p>The profuseness with which they were used among the
    Greeks, the Romans, the Egyptians, and other ancient
    nations in their religious solemnities, their public ceremonies,
    and even in the ordinary customs of private life,
    would lead us to suppose, and with some degree of correctness,
    that roses were very abundantly cultivated by
    them all; and we are inclined to think that their cultivation
    was then far more general than at the present time,
    although the art of producing them was in its infancy.
    However surprising in other respects may have been the
    progress of the culture of roses within forty years, particularly
    in France, Holland, and Belgium, there can be
    little doubt that, although the Romans were acquainted
    with a much smaller number of varieties than the moderns,
    yet flowers of those varieties were far more abundant
    than the aggregate quantity of flowers of all the
    varieties of roses cultivated at the present day. It cannot
    be positively asserted that the Remontant Roses of
    the present time were unknown at Rome, since the gardeners
    of that city practiced sowing the seeds of the Rose,
    by which mode many of the most remarkable varieties of
    that class have been obtained by modern cultivators. The
    Romans, however, preferred to propagate by cuttings,
    which produced flowering plants much sooner than those
    from the seed.</p>
<p>But, though the Romans may have had roses of the
    same species with some of those which we now cultivate,
    it is scarcely probable that these species could have continued
    until this period, and escaped the devastation attendant
    on the revolutions of empire, or the more desolating
    invasions of the Huns and Goths. Thus it is, that
    those roses of Pæstum, to which allusion is so frequently
    made by ancient writers, and which, according to Virgil
    and Pliny, bloomed semi-annually, and were common in
    the gardens of that city, are not now to be found. Jussieu
    and Loudresse, two French gentlemen, successively visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> Italy with the express object of finding this twice-bearing
    Rose in Pæstum or its environs, yet, notwithstanding
    their carefully prosecuted researches, they could
    find no traces of it whatever.</p>
<p>Although the number of varieties known to the Romans
    was very limited, they had discovered a method of
    making the blooming season continue many months. According
    to Pliny, the roses of Carthage, in Spain, came
    forward early and bloomed in winter; those of Campania
    bloomed next in order; then those of Malta; and lastly
    those of Pæstum, which flowered in the spring and autumn.
    It was probably the blooming of this last species
    which the gardeners of Rome discovered (in Seneca&rsquo;s
    time) the secret of retarding by a certain process, or of
    hastening by means of their warm green-houses.</p>
<p>In the last part of this work, we have cited many passages
    from ancient authors, which show to what an enormous
    extent the use of roses was carried by the Romans
    on certain occasions. It is difficult to credit, at this day,
    the relation of Nero&rsquo;s extravagance (which is, however,
    attested by Suetonius), when it is told that in one fête
    alone he expended in roses <i>only</i>, more than four millions
    of sesterces, or one hundred thousand dollars. It would
    be no easy matter, even at the present period of abundant
    cultivation of Roses, to obtain from all the nurseries
    of England, France, and America together, roses sufficient
    to amount to so large a sum.</p>
<p>The Romans derived the use of this flower from the
    Greeks. In Greece, and throughout the East, roses were
    cultivated, not only for the various purposes we have
    mentioned, but also for the extraction of their perfumes.
    Among the many plans which they adopted for preserving
    the flower was that of cutting off the top of a reed,
    splitting it down a short distance, and enclosing in it a
    number of rose-buds, which, being bound around with
    papyrus, prevented their fragrance from escaping. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> Greeks also deemed it a great addition to the fragrance
    of the Rose to plant garlic near its roots. The island of
    Rhodes, which has successively borne many names, was
    particularly indebted to the culture of roses for that which
    it bears at this day. It was the Isle of Roses, the Greek
    for Rose being &#929;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#957;,&mdash;Rodon.</p>
<p>Medals of Rhodes, whose reverse impressions present a
    rose in bloom on one side, and the sunflower on the other,
    are to be found even now in cabinets of curiosities.</p>
<p>Extravagance in roses, among the Romans, kept pace
    with the increase of their power, until they at length desired
    them at all seasons. At first they procured their
    winter&rsquo;s supply from Egypt, but subsequently attained
    themselves such skill in their culture as to produce them
    in abundance, even at the coldest season of the year;
    and, according to Seneca, by means of green-houses,
    heated by pipes filled with hot water. During the reign
    of Domitian, the forcing of roses was carried to such perfection,
    and flowers produced in winter in so great abundance,
    that those brought from Egypt, as before mentioned,
    excited only the contempt of the citizens of the
    world&rsquo;s metropolis.</p>
<p>This fact, as also handed down to us by the epigram
    of Martial, is of great assistance in estimating the importance
    of rose-culture at that period, and in showing how
    the art of cultivating this plant had spread, and how it
    was already far advanced among the ancient Romans and
    their contemporaries.</p>
<p>If the Egyptians cultivated roses for transportation to
    Rome during the winter, they must have had very extensive
    plantations for the purpose. The exportation could
    not have been of loose flowers, for they would have been
    withered long before the termination of the voyage; neither
    could it have been of rooted plants in a dormant
    state, as nurserymen now send them to every part of the
    world, because the Romans had at that time no means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> causing them to vegetate and bloom in the winter. On
    the contrary, the cultivators at Alexandria and Memphis
    must, of necessity, have sent them away in the vases and
    boxes in which they had planted them with that object,
    and when they were just beginning to break from the
    bud, in order that they might arrive at Rome at the moment
    they commenced expanding.</p>
<p>At that remote period, when navigation was far behind
    its present state of perfection, the voyage from the mouth
    of the Nile to the coast of Italy occupied more than
    twenty days. When this long voyage is considered, and
    also the quantity of roses required by the Romans to enwreath
    their crowns and garlands, to cover their tables
    and couches, and the pavements of their festive halls, and
    to surround the urns which contained the ashes of their
    dead, it is evident that the Egyptians, who traded in
    roses, in order to satisfy the prodigality of the Romans,
    would be compelled to keep in readiness a certain number
    of vessels to be laden with boxes or vases of rose-plants,
    so prepared as not to bloom before their delivery at
    Rome. The cost of roses thus delivered in Rome must
    have been immense, but we do not find a single passage
    in any of the ancient authors which can give any light on
    this point; they only tell us that nothing for the gratification
    of luxury was considered too costly by the wealthy
    Roman citizens. Nor do they afford more positive information
    as to the species of Rose cultivated on the borders
    of the Nile, to gratify this taste of the Romans. According
    to Delile, there were found in Egypt, at the time
    of the French expedition into that country, only the
    White Rose and the Centifolia, or hundred-leaved&mdash;two
    species not very susceptible of either a forcing or retarding
    culture. The only Rose known at that time, which
    bloomed in the winter, was the Rose of Pæstum, referred
    to by Virgil, as &ldquo;<i>biferique rosaria Pæsti</i>,&rdquo; and which
    was probably the same as our monthly Damask Rose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> and which produced in Egypt and Rome flowers at all
    seasons, as the Damask does now with us, under a proper
    mode of culture.</p>
<p>The extent to which the culture and commerce of roses
    was carried among the Romans is shown by the fact
    that, although they had confounded the tree and its flowers
    under one name&mdash;that of <i>Rosa</i>,&mdash;they nevertheless
    gave particular appellations to the gardens or ground
    planted with rose-bushes. They were termed a <i>Rosarium</i>,
    or a <i>Rosetum</i>. Ovid says, &ldquo;<i>Quot am&#339;na Rosaria flores.</i>&rdquo;
    The dealer in roses was also designated by the distinctive
    appellation of <i>Rosarius</i>.</p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>In the latter part of the decline of the Roman Empire,
    when paganism still existed to a great degree, there arose
    a people who formed, as it were, the connecting link between
    the ancient and modern world&mdash;a people who acknowledged
    but one Supreme Ruler, and his sole vicegerent,
    Mahomet; a people whose origin was among the
    wildest tribes of Ishmael&rsquo;s descendants, who possessed in
    a great degree the luxuries of civilized life, and among
    whom the arts, sciences, and agriculture, were very flourishing
    for many ages. Among the Moors of Spain, the
    culture of the Rose was pursued with as much scientific
    and practical method as at the present day, but with
    somewhat less happy results. When in Paris, some years
    since, we became acquainted with M. Hardy, the chief director
    of the Luxembourg gardens, and who is well
    known to rose growers, by the many beautiful varieties
    which he has originated. His interest in this subject was
    very great, and in 1828, he published in the <i>Journal des
    Jardins</i> some interesting observations which he had extracted
    from a manuscript of M. de la Neuville. The
    latter having been employed as military superintendent
    in Spain during the war of 1823, translated from a
    Spanish version some parts of an Arabian work upon culture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> in general, in which that of the Rose was mentioned,
    with some important particulars. It stated that the
    Moors, who formerly conquered Spain, attached the highest
    value to this most beautiful of their flowers, and cultivated
    it with as much care as we do ourselves. &ldquo;According
    to Abu-el-Jaïr,&rdquo; says the translation, &ldquo;there are roses
    of many colors&mdash;carnation white, fallow or yellow,
    lapis-lazuli, or sky-blue. Some are of this last color on
    the outside, and yellow within. In the East they are acquainted
    with roses which are variegated with yellow and
    sky-blue, the inside of the corolla being of the one color,
    and the outside the other. The yellow-heart is very common
    in Tripoli and Syria, and the blue-heart is found on
    the coast of Alexandria.&rdquo; To us, at the present day, this
    relation may with reason seem incredible, since amid the
    numerous varieties now existing, and the skill of their
    cultivators, we have in no instance been able to obtain a
    blue Rose. Abu-el-Jaïr may have ventured to state it as
    a fact without proper authority, for, according to M. de
    la Neuville, Abu-Abdallah-ebu-el-Fazel, another nearly
    contemporaneous author, enumerated a variety of roses
    without mentioning the blue. &ldquo;There are,&rdquo; says this last
    author, &ldquo;four varieties of roses: the first is named the
    Double White; it has an exquisite odor, and its cup
    unites more than a hundred petals: the second is the Yellow,
    which is of a golden color, and bright as the jonquil;
    then the Purple; and lastly the flesh-colored, which is the
    most common of them all.&rdquo; Farther on the same author
    adds: &ldquo;The number of species is supposed to be large:
    the Mountain or Wild; the Double, which is variegated
    with red and white shades; and the Chinese. The Double,
    however, is the most beautiful, and is composed of forty
    to fifty petals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Moors multiplied roses by all the various methods
    which are employed at this day: by suckers from the
    root, by cuttings, by budding, and by grafting. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> pruning-knife was also freely used, in order to form regular
    heads.</p>
<p>There is a farther translation of De la Neuville from a
    Spanish version of the &ldquo;Book of Agriculture,&rdquo; written by
    Ebu-Alwan, who lived in the twelfth century, and who, in
    addition to his own experience, quoted largely from some
    Chaldaic and Arabic writers. He states that the Moors
    practiced two methods of sowing the seeds of the Rose.
    The first was in earthen pans&mdash;a mode adapted to delicate
    plants; they were watered immediately after being sown,
    and afterward twice a week until autumn, when such care
    became unnecessary. The other method was sowing
    broadcast as grain is sown, then covering the seed-beds
    an inch deep with carefully sifted manure or fine mould,
    and giving them the requisite watering. The plants from
    these seed-beds did not produce flowers until the third
    year after their being thus prepared, and until they had
    been transplanted into squares or borders; such is still the
    case with nearly all our summer roses, the only kind the
    Moors appear to have possessed. They also understood
    the art of forcing roses. &ldquo;If you wish,&rdquo; says Haj, another
    author, &ldquo;the Rose tree to bloom in autumn, you
    must choose one that has been accustomed to periodical
    waterings; you must deprive it of water entirely during
    the heat of summer until August, and then give it an
    abundance of moisture; this will hasten its growth, and
    cause the expansion of its flowers in great profusion,
    without impairing its ability to bloom the ensuing spring,
    as usual.&rdquo; &ldquo;Or else,&rdquo; adds the same author, &ldquo;in the
    month of October, burn the old branches to the level of
    the earth, moisten the soil for eight consecutive days, and
    then suspend the watering; alternate these periods of
    moisture and drought as many as five times, and probably
    in about sixty days, or before the end of autumn, the roots
    will have thrown out vigorous branches, which will in due
    time be loaded with flowers, without destroying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> ability of the plant to bloom again the following spring.&rdquo;
    The climate in which the Moors lived&mdash;that of Cordova,
    Grenada, and Seville, where the winter is very much like
    our weather in mid-autumn&mdash;was very favorable to the
    cultivation of the Rose. In this country the same results
    could doubtless be obtained in the Carolinas, and the
    experiment would be well worth trying, even in the latitude
    of New York. It would be no small triumph to
    obtain an autumnal bloom of the many beautiful varieties
    of French, Moss, or Provence Roses. Haj has also given
    the method of keeping the Rose in bud, in order to prolong
    its period of blooming. His process, however, is of
    so uncertain a character, as scarcely to merit an insertion
    here. The manuscript of De la Neuville also contains
    particular directions for propagating roses, and for planting
    hedges of the Eglantine, to protect the vineyards and
    gardens, and at the same time to serve as stocks for grafting.
    Nothing is omitted in the Arabian treatise which
    pertains to the management of this shrub; the manner of
    cultivating, weeding, transplanting, watering, etc., are
    all particularly explained. Among a variety of curious
    matters, it contains the process by which, for the purpose
    of embellishing their gardens, they produced the appearance
    of trees whose tops are loaded with roses. A hollow
    pipe, four feet long, or more, if the top was to be large,
    was obtained, of a well-proportioned diameter, set upright,
    to resemble the trunk of a tree, and filled with earth
    or sand in a suitable state of moisture. In the top of
    this pipe were planted several varieties of roses, of different
    colors, which, rooting freely in the earth around them,
    soon formed a bushy head, and represented a third-class
    tree, clothed with rich foliage and beautiful flowers.</p>
<p>This plan could now be practiced with success; and
    we can scarcely imagine more beautiful objects in a lawn
    than a number of these pipes, of various heights, single,
    and in groups, some low, with the small heads of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> China or Tea Roses, others high, and with the large, robust
    branches of the La Reine, and other Perpetuals, and
    others, again, planted with some delicate climbing roses,
    whose branches, falling down, would form a weeping tree
    of a most unique, graceful, and showy character. The
    pipes could be made of earthenware, tin, or wood, and be
    painted in imitation of the bark of a tree. Still better
    would be the trunk of a small tree, hollowed out for the
    purpose, which, with the bark on, would puzzle many a
    close observer, and which could show a luxuriant head of
    leaves and flowers on the most sterile soil that ever formed
    a lawn.</p>
<p>From what has been said on the culture of roses among
    the Moors in Spain, there can be no doubt that they had
    made great progress therein; and with the exception of a
    few statements, evidently unfounded in fact, as the grafting
    of the Rose on the almond, the apple, the jujube, and
    other trees, the little treatise translated by De la Neuville
    certainly contains most excellent remarks upon the culture
    of roses, whether we compare them with what the ancients
    have left us, or even with those of the various
    writers on Rose culture in Europe and America within
    the last half century.</p>
<p>As roses were so frequently propagated from the seed
    by the Moors, they must have known quite a number of
    varieties, exclusive of all those they had brought or obtained
    from the East. The Yellow Rose, unknown to us
    until recently, was apparently familiar to them; and the
    Blue Rose, of which their manuscripts speak, is now extinct,
    if it indeed ever existed; for amid the infinite
    variety of roses, of every color and shade, produced from
    seed in modern times, no one has yet obtained a purely
    Blue Rose, and its former existence may well seem to us
    incredible.</p>
<p>Besides the Moorish cultivation in Spain, the Rose has
    been an object of culture to a great extent in other countries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> It has been cultivated principally for the beauty of
    its flowers, but in many parts of Europe and Asia, and in
    the north of Africa, its culture has been pursued for commercial
    purposes. Of its abundance in Palestine, some
    conception may be formed from the statement of travelers,
    that they have not only seen them wild and in great
    profusion in the vicinity of Jerusalem, but have found
    them in hedges, intermingled with pomegranate trees.
    Doubday states that, when the Eastern Christians made
    one of their processions in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre
    at Jerusalem, which continued some two hours, many
    persons were present with sacks full of rose petals, which
    they threw by handfuls on the people, and in such immense
    quantities, that many were covered with them, and
    they were scattered all over the pavement. In Syria and
    Persia it has been cultivated from a very early period, and
    the ancient name of the former, <i>Suristan</i>, is said to signify
    the land of roses. Damascus, Cashmere, Barbary, and
    Fayoum in Egypt, all cultivated the Rose extensively for
    its distilled oil or essence. Very little is extant respecting
    the culture of the Rose in the middle ages, but that it was
    cultivated and valued is known by its having been worn
    by knights at the tournament, as an emblem of their devotion
    to grace and beauty. According to Loudon,
    &ldquo;Ludovico Verthema, who traveled in the East in 1503,
    observed that Tæssa was particularly celebrated for roses,
    and that he saw a great quantity of these flowers at Calicut.&rdquo;
    The Rose is to this day also extensively cultivated
    in India, and for commercial purposes perhaps in greater
    abundance than is now known in any other country.
    Bishop Heber states that &ldquo;Ghazepoor is celebrated
    throughout India for the wholesomeness of its air and the
    beauty and extent of its rose gardens. The rose-fields,
    which occupy many hundred acres in the neighborhood,
    are described as, at the proper season, extremely beautiful.
    They are cultivated for distillation and for making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> &lsquo;Attar of Roses.&rsquo;&rdquo; He states also, that &ldquo;many roses
    were growing in the garden of the palace of Delhi, and
    the fountain pipes were carved with images of roses.&rdquo;
    Another writer describes in glowing colors the beauty of
    Ghazepoor, the Gul-istan (the rose beds,) of Bengal. &ldquo;In
    the spring of the year, an extent of miles around the
    town presents to the eye a continual garden of roses, than
    which nothing can be more beautiful and fragrant. The
    sight is perfectly dazzling; the plain, as far as the eye can
    reach, extending in the same bespangled carpet of red and
    green. The breezes, too, are loaded with the sweet odor
    which is wafted far across the river Ganges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These statements sufficiently evince that the Rose was
    not only valued by the Hindoos as an article of commerce,
    but was intimately associated with their ideas of pleasure
    and enjoyment.</p>
<p>Persia, however, was, above all other countries, preëminent
    for roses. &ldquo;Sir John Chardin, in 1686, found the
    gardens of the Persians without parterres, labyrinths, and
    other ornaments of European gardens, but filled with
    lilies, peach trees, and roses; and all modern travelers
    bear testimony to the esteem in which this flower is held
    in the East.&rdquo; Sir Wm. Ousley tells us, in his travels in
    Persia, in 1819, that when he entered the flower garden
    belonging to the Governor of the Castle, near Farso, he
    was overwhelmed with roses; and Jackson, in his <i>Journey,
    etc.</i>, says that the roses of the Sinan Nile, or Garden of
    the Nile, are unequalled; and mattresses are made of their
    leaves, for men of rank to recline upon. Buckingham
    speaks of the rose plantations of Damascus as occupying
    an area of many acres, about three miles from that city.
    Sir Robert Ker Porter, speaking of the garden of one of
    the royal palaces of Persia, says: &ldquo;I was struck with the
    appearance of two rose trees, full fourteen feet high, laden
    with thousands of flowers, in every degree of expansion,
    and of a bloom and delicacy of scent that imbued the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> whole atmosphere with exquisite perfume. Indeed, I believe
    that in no country in the world does the rose grow
    in such perfection as in Persia; in no country is it so cultivated
    and prized by the natives. Their gardens and
    courts are crowded by its plants, their rooms ornamented
    with roses, filled with its gathered branches, and every
    bath strewed with the full-blown flowers, plucked with
    the ever-replenished stems. * * * But in this delicious
    garden of Negaaristan, the eye and the smell are not
    the only senses regaled by the presence of the Rose: the
    ear is enchanted by the wild and beautiful notes of multitudes
    of nightingales, whose warblings seem to increase
    in melody and softness, with the unfolding of their favorite
    flowers. Here, indeed, the stranger is more powerfully
    reminded, that he is in the genuine country of the
    nightingale and the Rose.&rdquo; Rivers mentions that Sir
    John Malcolm told him, that when in Persia he had once
    breakfasted on an immense heap, or rather mount, of roses,
    which the Persians had raised in honor of him. The rose
    of Cashmere has been long celebrated in the East, for its
    brilliancy and delicacy of odor&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&ldquo;Who has not heard of the Vale of Cashmere,<br />
        </span> <span class="i1">With its Roses, the brightest that earth ever gave?&rdquo;<br />
        </span> </div>
</div>
<p>Throughout the whole season during which the roses
    remained in bloom in this beautiful valley, the Feast of
    Roses was kept with great rejoicing, and an entire abandonment
    to pleasure. At this time, a great number of
    tents were pitched, and multitudes of men, women, boys,
    and girls, were dancing and singing to the music of their
    various instruments.</p>
<p>All that has been handed down to us, and all we know
    at the present time of the climate and productions of
    Persia, and the customs of its inhabitants, prove that it
    was emphatically the land of roses; and all that we can
    gather from its history or tradition evinces, that to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> inhabitants of the East, including the Hindoos and the
    Moors of Spain, is this beautiful flower indebted for the
    most careful and abundant cultivation, and for a due appreciation
    of its merits.</p>
<p>At the present time the Rose is cultivated throughout
    the civilized world. Loudon speaks of hedges of mixed
    Provence Roses, in the garden of Rosenstein, in Germany,
    and also of their profusion in the public garden of Frankfort.
    They are found in the gardens of Valencia, in
    Spain, and Sir John Carr, speaking of the seat of a Spanish
    gentleman near Tarragona, says, &ldquo;The doors of the
    dining room open into a small garden, the walls of which
    are covered with myrtles, jasmines, and roses.&rdquo; In the
    Botanic garden of Madrid, rose trees are used for dividing
    hedges, and the flower is a favorite throughout Spain.</p>
<p>Among the Spanish ladies, the Rose is highly valued,
    and, with the Orange flower, is a favorite ornament for the
    hair. We have frequently been struck, while traveling in
    the Spanish West Indies, and in some parts of South
    America, with the careful nurture and attention bestowed
    on a single rose bush, and the delight exhibited at its bloom,
    while all around in natural luxuriance were the most beautiful
    and gorgeous plants and flowers which the tropics
    can produce. The brilliant cactus, the beautiful oleander,
    the singular orchids, and the delicate and fragrant flowers
    of the coffee and orange, seemed cast into the shade by
    the ancient and well-known Rose.</p>
<p>I well recollect, that on returning one day from a ride into
    the country, where I had been luxuriating in the gorgeous
    splendor of a tropical forest, the fair daughter of my hostess
    wished to introduce me to a flower, which, in her
    opinion, far surpassed all that I had seen; she accompanied
    me to the top of the flat-roofed house, used at the South
    as a place of evening resort, and there, in one corner, I
    found a thrifty plant of the Tea Rose, which to her infinite
    delight, was just showing above its glossy and delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> young leaves, a little ruby-tipped bud. This little plant
    had been the object of long and careful nursing, and her
    attention was now about to be rewarded by a fine and
    perfect bloom.</p>
<p>In France, however, is the Rose a preëminent object of
    horticulture, both in commercial establishments and in
    private gardens. The skill of the French has originated
    many new and beautiful varieties, which are to be found
    in several of the nurseries in the United States. The
    French are constantly searching for improvements in horticultural
    science and practice, with an enthusiasm rarely
    found in the more cold Englishman, whose skill seems to
    consist less in the creation of new varieties, than in growing
    perfectly those already known. None, indeed, can
    surpass the English in the art of growing fine plants, but
    we are chiefly indebted to the French for the finest new
    varieties of the Rose.</p>
<p>In Great Britain, although comparatively little attention
    has been paid to the obtaining of new varieties, the culture
    is more careful and the nomenclature more correct. The
    competition excited by their numerous horticultural exhibitions
    causes great attention to be given to correct
    nomenclature and to symmetrical habit of growth. We
    can imagine nothing more beautiful than some of the
    plants that we saw at the exhibitions of the London Horticultural
    Society at Chiswick; every plant was pruned,
    trained and grown, after an ideal, but perfect model, with
    its close and luxuriant foliage, its thrifty, symmetrical
    habit, and the thick, leathery petals of its well-cupped
    flower. This high standard should be introduced into
    every Society, and if such were the case in this country
    and the rule were carefully obeyed, the character of our exhibitions
    would in a short time be very materially changed.</p>
<p>T. Rivers is one of the most extensive rose cultivators
    in England, and is also known as the author of a very excellent
    descriptive work on the Rose. He has also been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> successful in hybridizing, and has originated come very fine
    varieties. His attention was at one time directed almost
    exclusively to the Rose, but it now includes many other
    nursery articles, and on our visit to him, we found him
    much interested with experiments in fruit culture. Lane,
    Wood, and Paul, are esteemed very good cultivators, and
    generally correct in their nomenclature. From these several
    establishments in England and France have been imported
    most of the varieties now existing in this country.
    Their trade with the United States is, however, comparatively
    limited, from the great risk of loss by a sea voyage.
    We have frequently lost in this way two-thirds or three-quarters
    of an importation, to our great annoyance and
    expense, and it is only by repeated and persevering importations
    that we have been able to obtain all the desirable
    varieties.</p>
<p>In the United States the culture of the Rose has been
    very much neglected, until within a few years. Tulips
    and dahlias have successively been the rage, and although
    there has long existed a great variety of roses, comparatively
    few of them have been cultivated, even in the best
    gardens of the United States. Now the tide is turning.
    Dahlias are going out of repute, and the Rose is resuming
    its ancient empire in the queendom of Flora. The advent
    of the Bourbon and the Remontant, or Perpetual classes,
    has no doubt materially aided this change, but it is in a
    great part owing to the easy culture of the plant, and the
    intrinsic merits and beauty of the flower. The taste of
    the horticultural public being thus decidedly for the Rose,
    a demand will exist for all the information respecting soil,
    planting, cultivating, etc., and this information we shall
    endeavor to supply in a simple and concise manner, avoiding,
    as far as possible, all technicalities, and adapting it to
    the use of the cultivator of a single plant in the crowded
    border of a city garden, or to the more extended culture
    of a commercial establishment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>
<p>Each cultivator has his peculiar mode of doing things,
    and there may be those who deem the mode laid down
    here inferior to their own. From these we should be glad
    to hear, and to make any corrections they may suggest,
    where such corrections appear to be founded upon true
    principles. In order to make our work as perfect as possible,
    we have not hesitated to add to our own experience
    all the information derived from a personal inspection of
    French and English nurseries, and to cull from foreign
    works and periodicals all that may interest our readers.
    Such information, as far as it coincides with our own experience,
    we shall gladly incorporate, with the hope that
    we may be successful in presenting every fact of interest
    which may exist respecting the cultivation of our favorite
    flower.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>
<h3>SOIL, SITUATION, AND PLANTING.</h3>
<p>The most suitable soil is a strong, rich loam, or vegetable
    mould mixed with about one-quarter its bulk of well-decomposed
    stable manure. If the soil of the garden
    where the roses are to be planted differs materially from
    this, it should be made to approach it as nearly as possible
    by the addition of the requisite soil and manure. In a
    good vegetable garden, the soil, with the addition of a
    little manure, will grow the Rose well. When the soil,
    however, is of an inferior character, holes should be dug
    three or four times the size of the roots of a well-grown
    rose bush and filled with compost of the above character.</p>
<p>Rivers recommends, as the best compost for roses, rotten
    dung and pit-sand for cold, clayey soils; and for warm,
    dry soils, rotten dung and cool loams. He also states
    that he has found night soil, mixed with the drainings of
    the dunghill, or even with common ditch or pond water,
    so as to make a thick liquid, the best possible manure for
    roses, poured on the surface of the soil twice in winter&mdash;one
    to two gallons to each tree. The soil need not be
    stirred until spring, and then merely loosened two or three
    inches deep, with the prongs of a fork; for poor soil, and
    on lawns, previously removing the turf, this will be found
    most efficacious. He directs this compost to be applied
    in the first two winter months, but as our ground is frequently
    frozen so hard then that it cannot absorb the
    liquid, it would probably be best to apply it in this country
    a month earlier. Where a bed or border of roses is
    to be planted, it is well to dig out the soil to the depth
    of two or two and a half feet; fill the bottom to the depth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> of six inches with small stones, and then replace the earth,
    well fertilized, as directed above. Nothing is more injurious
    to the Rose than a wet, retentive subsoil; and
    where expense and trouble are no object, this perfect
    draining is much the best calculated to ensure a thrifty
    growth and perfect bloom. A rich and dry soil is, in fact,
    all-important; for otherwise the most double flower will
    frequently become single or semi-double. We have seen
    a plant of La Reine produce a perfect flower in the green-house,
    and when removed to an inferior soil, produce
    flowers almost single. It may therefore be safely laid
    down as a rule, that it is impossible to make the soil too
    rich for the Rose, and that in proportion to the fertilizing
    matter contained therein, provided it is properly decomposed,
    will be the approximation of the plant and the
    flower to perfection. The fertility of the soil may be very
    much assisted by frequent applications of liquid manure,
    made either of cow dung or guano; the former is always
    safe; the latter, valuable if properly used, may, in the
    hands of a careless person, ruin the plant.</p>
<p>In these remarks on fertility of soil, we have no desire
    to discourage those who may not have a fertile soil, or the
    means of obtaining the elements of fertility. The Rose
    will grow and bloom in any soil; the wood will be
    healthy, but short and small; the flower will be produced,
    but, as we have said before, will be smaller and often semi-double;
    yet even under these disadvantages, it is still the
    most desirable flower for the poor man; none other can
    so cheaply and so well ornament his small yard, or hanging
    in graceful festoons about his windows, shed forth its
    bloom and sweetness to enliven his hours of relief from
    labor, and give his children happiness, from the association
    of pleasant thought with natural beauty. But the
    poor man has within his reach more than he supposes of
    the elements of fertility. The ashes of his hearth, the
    decomposed turf of the road-side, and the domestic manure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> too generally thrown away, all contain some of the
    best fertilizing matter, and with proper care could be
    made amply sufficient for the production of his flowers
    and vegetables. The decomposed turf alone would grow
    roses admirably, although a little manure would be a useful
    addition.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">SITUATION.</p>
<p>The best situation for the Rose is an eastern or northern
    exposure, rather than a southern; the intensity of the heat
    of our midsummer often affects injuriously the expansion
    of the flowers, their color, and fragrance. A useful degree
    of shade can be obtained by planting amidst groups
    of dwarf roses, pillars, trellises, obelisks, etc., on which
    climbing roses can be trained, and whose shadow, changing
    with the sun, would protect the opening bloom and
    answer the same end as a cool situation. While, however,
    the Rose requires a cool, airy locality, it should by no
    means be placed entirely in the shade; a portion of the
    sun&rsquo;s rays is always necessary to ensure a good bloom. It
    is from this cause that the bloom of roses is much more
    certain and perfect in France and this country than in
    England. In the latter country, the sun is scarcely ever
    sufficiently powerful to develop all the resources of a
    plant. The summer of 1846 was unprecedentedly hot
    throughout England, and all the horticultural journals
    united in pronouncing the bloom of roses that season unsurpassed
    by the bloom of any previous year. For climbing
    roses the situation should not be too exposed, or where
    they would be liable to encounter heavy winds, which
    might break off the young shoots and in other ways injure
    the plant. Most of our American cities possess in the
    culture of roses a great advantage over the large towns
    of England, in the use of anthracite instead of bituminous
    coal; for, according to Loudon, the Rose will not thrive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> in towns where the prevailing fuel is of this character, and
    the bloom will not compare with those produced some ten
    miles distant. &ldquo;The first effect of the smoke is to prevent
    the flower buds from opening freely, next to diminish
    their number; the leaves then gradually become smaller,
    and the length of the shoots less, after which the plant
    weakens by degrees, and in a few years, if a standard, it
    dies altogether, or, if a dwarf, barely exists, and seldom
    if ever flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a result, from such a cause, is rarely known here,
    and the resident of the city may have his little yard filled
    with roses whose bloom will be in no way inferior to that
    of the plants in an extensive lawn or garden.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">PLANTING.</p>
<p>All those roses that bloom only once in the year, and
    also the Perpetuals, or Remontant Roses, can be planted
    in autumn, after the first severe frost. The ends of the
    roots, which have been broken in taking up, will then form
    a callus, and the soil will be so thoroughly settled about
    the roots by the winter rains, that the plant will commence
    forming new roots early in the spring, and will rapidly
    make strong and luxuriant shoots. As far north as
    New York and its vicinity, the Bourbons and the Bengal,
    with their sub-classes, being more delicate, should not be
    planted until spring.</p>
<p>If the subsoil is wet and retentive of moisture, the
    planting of any roses should be deferred until spring, but
    from our preceding remarks it will be borne in mind that
    such soil should be well drained before planting, in which
    case the autumn will still answer.</p>
<p>The plant should be taken up carefully, with all the root
    possible, bearing in mind that the elements of life are in
    the root, and every fibre that is lost is so much taken from
    the future health and prosperity of the plant. The root<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> should then be carefully examined, and every portion that
    has been bruised should be cut off; all the broken ends
    should also be cut away as far as they are split or injured.
    Any root of the character of a tap-root, or growing directly
    down into the earth, should be cut off; for it is best
    to encourage only lateral roots, which can more readily
    partake of the benefits of the rain and sun, and can more
    effectually absorb the nutriment in the soil.</p>
<p>In the spring the hole for each plant should be dug
    somewhat larger than the root, and the bottom forked,
    or dug up, and if necessary enriched with the surface
    soil, which, it is presumed, has been prepared according
    to preceding directions. Let one hold the plant, while
    another throws in the soil; or if one alone is planting, let him
    hold the stem just above the root with one hand, and throw
    in the soil with the other, moving the stem from side to side,
    and occasionally pulling it upward a little and shaking the
    root until the soil has worked well among the fibres; on
    which much of the subsequent prosperity of the plant depends.
    If the weather is dry, a little water may be
    placed in the hole, which should then be filled up and the
    soil well trodden down about the stem. When planted,
    it should be very little, if at all, lower in the ground than
    before; very little of the stem should be buried; and
    when trodden down, the root should be made firm and
    solid.</p>
<p>In planting climbing or pillar roses, care should be
    taken to set the trellis, or pillar, or whatever may be used
    for their support, before the plant is put in the ground;
    for if such should be set after the plant has commenced
    growing vigorously, it will in all probability damage the
    roots, and give the plant a check from which it will not
    recover during the whole season.</p>
<p>The Rose, even in the best soils, should be taken up every
    three or four years, and have its roots shortened and
    pruned; a portion of the soil in which it grew should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> also be removed and replaced by soil of the character before
    described. Where the soil is poor, they should be
    taken up every other year, and replanted, after renewing
    the soil as above, or digging it with plenty of manure.</p>
<p>Van Mons states that in Belgium the plants are uniformly
    taken up at the end of eight years and placed in
    fresh soil, or they are thrown away and young plants substituted
    in their place. This substitution of young plants
    is perhaps the most certain mode of ensuring a continual
    supply of strong, healthy wood and well-formed flowers.</p>
<p>The Rose may be transplanted at any season, provided
    the shoots are pruned closely and deprived of all their
    leaves, and the soil in which they are planted kept well
    watered. The flowering also may be retarded in this
    way, and those roses that bloom only once in the season,
    if they are transplanted just before they are coming into
    flower, and properly pruned, will bloom in autumn. The
    autumn and spring, or the dormant season, however, is
    the proper period for all transplanting.</p>
<p>Whether planted in autumn or spring, if purchased of
    a nurseryman, they should be <i>ordered</i> in the autumn. In
    the spring, as soon as the frost is out of the ground, the
    first few warm days, operating upon their excitable nature,
    will start them into growth. If then the nurseryman has
    a large number of orders on hand, some of them will inevitably
    be delayed until the plants have grown too much.
    If ordered in the autumn, the purchaser should not expect
    to receive them before the 10th or 15th of November.
    No nurseryman who values his reputation will allow roses
    to leave his grounds before the vegetation is checked by
    several heavy frosts, and the wood and roots allowed time
    thereafter to thoroughly ripen. Dealers who desire roses
    early, in order to deliver with other plants, sometimes
    rebel at this; but purchasers should understand that roses
    will not flourish unless the wood and roots are thoroughly
    ripe. This applies more particularly to the Remontant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> Moss, and June roses. The Tea, China, and Noisette,
    will bear taking up at any time, but their roots will rarely
    be in a condition to endure the cold as far north as New
    York without some protection. When received from the
    nurseryman in the autumn, they should be carefully and
    separately heeled-in in a dry piece of land, and covered
    with sand. A covering of litter should be avoided, because
    it affords a harbor for mice, who would soon destroy
    the plants.</p>
<p>Plants from the open ground are always to be preferred
    by the purchaser. Those sold in pots in the spring have
    frequently been forced, and will require a long period of
    rest before growing again, while those from the open
    ground, having had their rest, will grow luxuriantly at
    once.</p>
<p>It should also be remembered by the purchaser that the
    delicate roots of the Rose will not bear exposure to the
    air. All reputable nurserymen understand this, and pack
    in moss. Dealers, however, who purchase of these nurserymen,
    and who have many lots to deliver after they are
    unpacked, are often not sufficiently careful to guard the
    roots against exposure. The plants then failing to grow
    well, the fault is attributed to some deficiency in the plant,
    rather than to its true cause. To ensure safety while being
    delivered, dealers should dip them, as soon as unpacked,
    in a puddle of mud of the consistency of thick
    paint. This precaution is useful in every case after unpacking
    and before planting, for there must always be
    some delay and exposure even when the purchaser obtains
    plants directly from the grower.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>
<h3>PRUNING, TRAINING, AND BEDDING.</h3>
<p>In pruning roses at the time of transplanting, the principal
    object to be attained is relief to the plant by taking
    away all the wood and branches which the diminished
    root may not be able to support. The mode of pruning
    depends very much upon the condition of the plant. If
    it is very bushy, all the weaker branches should be cut
    away, leaving not more than three or four of the strongest
    shoots, and shortening even those down to a few eyes.
    If it is desired that the plant should continue dwarf and
    bushy, the new wood should be cut down to the lower
    two eyes, and every half-grown or slender shoot cut out.
    These two eyes will each throw out a branch; then cut
    these branches down to the two eyes, and again cut back
    the shoots they produce until a symmetrical habit is
    formed, with close, thick foliage. There should not be
    sufficient wood allowed to remain to make the bush
    crowded; and if there should be danger of this, some of
    the branches, instead of being cut down to two eyes,
    should be removed altogether.</p>
<p>Climbing roses, when planted, should be cut down almost
    to the ground, and also carefully thinned out. Only
    a few of the strongest branches should be preserved, and
    the new wood of these cut down to two eyes each.</p>
<p>The preceding remarks are applicable to roses at the
    time of planting; they should also be pruned every year,&mdash;the
    hardy varieties in the autumn or winter, and the
    more tender in the spring. For all roses that are not liable
    to have part of their wood killed by the cold, the
    autumn is decidedly the best time for pruning; the root,
    having then but little top to support, is left at liberty to
    store up nutriment for a strong growth the following
    season. The principal objects in pruning are the removal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> of the old wood, because it is generally only the young
    wood that produces large and fine flowers; the shortening
    and thinning out of the young wood, that the root, having
    much less wood to support, may devote all its nutriment
    to the size and beauty of the flower; and the formation
    of a symmetrical shape. If an abundant bloom is desired,
    without regard to the size of the flower, only the
    weak shoots should be cut out, and the strong wood
    should be shortened very little; each bud will then produce
    a flower. By this mode, the flowers will be small,
    and the growth of new wood very short, but there will
    be an abundant and very showy bloom. If, however, the
    flowers are desired as large and as perfect as possible, all
    the weak wood should be cut out entirely, and all the
    strong wood formed the last season should be cut down
    to two eyes. The knife should always be applied directly
    above a bud, and sloping upward from it. The
    preceding observations apply principally to rose bushes,
    or dwarf roses; with pillar, climbing, and tree roses, the
    practice should be somewhat different. The former two
    need comparatively little pruning; they require careful
    thinning out, but should seldom be shortened. The very
    young side shoots can sometimes be shortened in, to prevent
    the foliage from becoming too thick and crowded.</p>
<p>Pillars for roses can be made of trellis work, of iron
    rods in different forms, or of wood, but they should enclose
    a space of at least a foot in diameter. The cheapest
    plan, and one that will last many years, is to make posts
    of about 1½ or 2 inches square, out of locust or pitch-pine
    plank, and connect them with common hoop-iron.
    They should be the length of a plank&mdash;between twelve
    and thirteen feet&mdash;and should be set three feet in the
    ground, that they may effectually resist the action of the
    wind. The Rose having been cut down to the ground, is
    planted inside of the pillar, and will make strong growths
    the first season. As the leading shoots appear, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> should be trained spirally around the outside of the pillar,
    and sufficiently near each other to enable them to fill up
    the intermediate space with their foliage. These leading
    shoots will then form the permanent wood, and the young
    side shoots, pruned in from year to year, will produce the
    flowers, and at the flowering season cover the whole pillar
    with a mass of rich and showy bloom. Figure 5 gives
    the appearance of a pillar of this kind. If the tops of
    the leading shoots die down at all, they should be shortened
    down to the first strong eye, because, if a weak bud is
    left at the top, its growth will be slender for a long time.
    The growth of different varieties of roses is very varied;
    some make delicate shoots, and require little room, while
    others, like the Queen of the Prairies, are exceedingly robust,
    and may require a larger pillar than the size we have
    mentioned. Figure 6 shows the method of constructing
    a pyramid by the use of a central post and iron rods.</p>

    <div class="caption"> Fig. 7.&mdash;A ROSE ARBOR.</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Climbing roses require very much the same treatment
    as pillar roses, and are frequently trained over arches, or
    in festoons from one pillar to another. In these the weak
    branches should also be thinned out, and the strong ones
    be allowed to remain, without being shortened, as in these
    an abundant bloom is wanted, rather than large flowers.
    An arbor, made by training roses from one pillar to
    another, is represented in figure 7. In training climbing
    roses over any flat surface, as a trellis, wall, or side of a
    house, the principal point is so to place the leading
    shoots that all the intermediate space may be filled up
    with foliage. They can either be trained in fan-shape,
    with side shoots growing out from a main stem, or
    one leading shoot can be encouraged and trained in
    parallel horizontal lines to the top, care being taken to
    preserve sufficient intermediate space for the foliage.
    Where no shoots are wanted, the buds can be rubbed off
    before they push out. No weak shoots should be allowed
    to grow from the bottom, but all the strong ones
    should be allowed to grow as much as they may. When
    the intermediate space is filled with young wood and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> foliage, all the thin, small shoots should be cut out every
    year, and the strongest buds only allowed to remain,
    which, forming strong branches, will set closely to the
    wall and preserve a neat appearance.</p>
<p>The production of roses out of season, by forcing, was,
    as we have shown, well known to the ancient Romans,
    and from them has been handed down to the present time.
    But the retarding of roses by means of a regular process
    of pruning owes its origin to a comparatively modern
    date. This process is mentioned both by Lord Bacon and
    Sir Robert Boyle. The latter says: &ldquo;It is delivered by
    the <i>Lord Verulam</i>, and other naturalists, that if a rose
    bush be carefully cut as soon as it is done bearing in the
    summer, it will again bear roses in the autumn. Of this,
    many have made unsuccessful trials, and thereupon report
    the affirmation to be false; yet I am very apt to think
    that my lord was encouraged by experience to write as
    he did. For, having been particularly solicitous about
    the experiment, I find by the relation, both of my own
    and other experienced gardeners, that this way of procuring
    autumnal roses will, in most rose bushes, commonly
    fail, but succeed in some that are good bearers; and, accordingly,
    having this summer made trial of it, I find that
    of a row of bushes cut in June, by far the greater number
    promise no autumnal roses; but one that hath manifested
    itself to be of a vigorous and prolific nature is, at
    this present, indifferently well stored with those of the
    damask kind. There may, also, be a mistake in the species
    of roses; for experienced gardeners inform me that the
    Musk Rose will, if it be a lusty plant, bear flowers in autumn
    without cutting; and, therefore, that may unjustly
    be ascribed to art, which is the bare production of nature.&rdquo;
    Thus, in quaint and ancient style, discourses the
    wise and pious philosopher on our favorite flower, and
    also mentions the fact, that a <i>red</i> rose becomes <i>white</i> on
    being exposed to the fumes of sulphur. This, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> had been observed before Sir Robert&rsquo;s time. Notwithstanding
    his doubts, it is now a well-established fact, that
    the blooming of roses may be retarded by cutting them
    back to two eyes after they have fairly commenced growing,
    and the flower buds are discoverable. A constant
    succession can be obtained where there is a number of
    plants, by cutting each one back a shorter or longer distance,
    or at various periods of its growth. In these cases,
    however, it very often will not bloom until autumn, because
    the second effort to produce flowers is much greater
    than the first, and is not attended with success until
    late in the season.</p>
<p>However desirable may be this retarding process, it
    cannot be relied on as a general practice, because the very
    unusual exertion made to produce the flowers a second
    time, weakens the plant, and materially affects its prosperity
    the subsequent year.</p>
<p>There is, indeed, but one kind of summer pruning that
    is advantageous, which is the thinning out of the flower-buds
    as soon as they appear, in order that the plant may
    be burdened with no more than it can fully perfect, and
    the cutting off all the seed vessels after the flower has
    expanded and the petals have fallen. Until this last is
    done, a second bloom cannot readily be obtained from the
    Bengal Rose and its sub-classes, the Tea and Noisette,
    which otherwise grow and bloom constantly throughout
    the season.</p>
<p>We would impress upon our readers the absolute, the
    essential, importance of cultivation&mdash;of constantly stirring
    the soil in which the Rose is planted; and we scarcely
    know of more comprehensive directions in a few words
    than the reply of an experienced horticulturist to one who
    asked the best mode of growing fine fruits and flowers.
    The old gentleman replied that the mode could be described
    in three words, &ldquo;cultivate, cultivate, cultivate.&rdquo;
    After the same manner, we would impress the importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> of these three words upon all those who love well-grown
    and beautiful roses. They are, indeed, <i>multum in parvo</i>&mdash;the
    very essence of successful culture. The soil cannot
    be plowed, dug, or stirred too much; it should be dug
    and hoed, not merely to keep down the weeds, but to ensure
    the health and prosperity of the plant. Cultivation
    is to all plants and trees manure, sun, and rain. It opens
    the soil to the nutrition it may receive from the atmosphere,
    to the beneficial influence of light, and to the morning and
    evening dew. It makes the heavy soil light, and the light
    soil heavy; if the earth is saturated with rain, it dries it;
    if burned up with drought, it moistens it. Watering is
    often beneficial, and is particularly so to roses just before
    and during the period of bloom; but in an extremely dry
    season, if we were obliged to choose between the watering-pot
    and the spade, we should most unhesitatingly give
    the preference to the latter.</p>
<p>We do not wish, however, to undervalue the benefits
    of water. If the plants are well mulched with straw,
    salt hay, or any other litter, frequent watering is very
    beneficial. When not mulched, the watering should always
    be followed by the hoe, in order to destroy the baking
    of the surface. While the plants are in a growing
    state, liquid manure will give a larger and a finer bloom.
    This liquid manure may be made with soapsuds, or the
    refuse from the house. When these are not easily obtained,
    half a bushel of cow or horse dung can be placed
    in a barrel, which can then be filled with water, well
    stirred up, and allowed to settle a day or two before being
    used.</p>
<p>For those who are willing to incur the expense, a very
    nice way of applying pure water is to sink ordinary tile,
    two inches in diameter, with collars, about a foot below
    the surface, around and through the rose bed. An elbow
    from this, coming to the surface, can convey the water
    into the pipes, through the joints of which it will escape,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> and thus irrigate the whole ground, without baking the
    surface.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">BEDDING ROSES.</p>
<p>While Remontant, Moss, and Garden Roses are adapted
    to the wants of much the larger number of growers, because
    they require no protection in winter, and are strong
    and robust in their growth and habit, yet the ever-blooming
    varieties are becoming daily more popular. While
    but few of the Remontants have more than two seasons
    of distinct and abundant bloom, the Teas, Chinas, and
    Noisettes, bloom constantly and continuously. In grace,
    and color, and beauty, these last have more varied charms
    than the more hardy and abundant Remontants, and the
    difficulty of caring for them in the winter, even by those
    who have no glass, is compensated by the additional pleasure
    they give in the summer. Those who have glass can
    enjoy them winter and summer alike. Their superiority
    in constant blooming, especially, adapts them for planting
    in masses or beds scattered about the lawn. These beds
    can be each of one color, or they can be assorted, or can
    be planted in the ribbon style, rows of white, or red, or
    yellow alternating. No bedding flowers, Verbenas, Salvias,
    or any other plant, will give so constant pleasure as
    Roses. They can be purchased, also, nearly as cheaply as
    ordinary bedding plants, and are found in several places
    as low as $15 per 100, or $100 per 1,000. On being taken
    out of the pots they will grow rapidly, and bloom after
    they are thoroughly established, and afterward, year after
    year, they will commence blooming early, and continue
    until frost. A bed made in any part of the lawn, and in
    any soil, will grow them well, provided it has a dry bottom,
    and has some well-decomposed manure dug in it. A
    light, sandy soil will grow them in the greatest perfection.
    They can be planted eighteen inches to two feet apart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> and the new shoots, as soon as they have attained sufficient
    length, should be pegged down, so as to cover the
    whole ground. The branches thus laid down will give
    abundant flowers throughout their whole length, and from
    each bud a strong-rooted shoot will be thrown up, and
    being pruned down close in the autumn, will be ready to
    produce a strong and bearing shoot another year. If
    they become too close and crowded, the new shoots can
    be partially cut away. North of Baltimore, these Roses
    will need protection in the winter. This can be done by
    covering the bed with sand, several inches deep, or by
    taking up the plants, cutting them down, heeling them in
    in a dry cellar, or potting them for a green-house.</p>

<h3>POTTING AND FORCING.</h3>

    <p class="tdc">&ldquo;Seek Roses in December, ice in June.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Byron</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every variety of Rose, in the hands of a skillful man,
    will grow and bloom well in pots, although the Bengal
    and its sub-classes, and the more dwarf Hardy Roses, are
    the most easily managed. The great point in potting is
    to imitate planting in the open ground as nearly as possible.
    The soil used should possess all the nutritious elements
    required in the open ground, and, if possible, in
    somewhat greater abundance. More manure should be
    used, because the frequent watering required by plants in
    pots must inevitably wash away a portion of the fertilizing
    matter. There is nothing better than one portion of
    stable manure, and three of turf, or leaf-mould, all well
    decomposed, and mixed with a little pure peat earth. A
    portion of night-soil, well incorporated with charcoal, is
    also very excellent. Charcoal is the most powerful absorbent
    known; it retains the nutritious elements in the
    night-soil, prevents their being washed away by watering,
    and gives them out as the plant needs them. English
    gardeners should bear in mind that roses require in this
    climate a stronger soil than in England. Half-gallon pots
    are the best size at first, from which, by repeated pottings,
    corresponding with the growth of the plant, they can be
    shifted to one or two-gallon pots. The size of the pots
    should, however, be regulated by the extent of the roots;
    it should be just sufficiently large to allow the roots to go
    in without crowding. A few broken pieces of pots or
    small lumps should be put in the bottom for drainage.
    When the plant is to be taken from the open ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> select one, the roots of which are not too large, and with a
    sharp spade cut around it a ball of earth about the size
    of the pot, depriving it at the same time of a portion of
    its top, as directed in remarks on pruning. It should
    stand in this state about a fortnight, until the roots have
    become callused, and the plant is somewhat accustomed
    to the loss of its roots and branches. It can then be
    safely taken up at any season, and transferred to the pot,
    which should then be filled in with earth, firm and solid.
    If potted in the autumn, after the leaves have fallen and
    the wood become mature, the above previous preparation
    is not required, but the plant can be taken up without a
    ball of earth, and after being pruned of its bruised or
    broken roots, placed in the pot. It should then be protected
    from the frost and light until it has entirely recovered
    from its change of habitation, when it can be placed
    in any cool spot free from frost, until it is wanted for
    forcing.</p>
<p>Roses may, without difficulty, by the above previous
    management, be forced to bloom in the latter part of winter,
    but where their bloom is desired at Christmas or
    New-Year, they should be gradually prepared for the
    space of a year previous. To produce roses the latter
    part of winter, our own management has been simple and
    effective, giving us as many flowers as a green-house and
    vinery full of pots could afford. After putting the plants
    in pots, as directed above, pruning them down to eight
    or ten buds, and hardening them in a shady place, they
    are removed to the vinery before the frost out of doors can
    have injured them, and cut down to two buds. The
    house is then kept as cool as possible, while the frost is
    carefully excluded by a light fire at night, and on fine
    days the sashes are opened, and plenty of air admitted.
    They are thus kept in a dormant state until the first of
    the year, when the heat is gradually increased to about
    70° by day, sinking as low as 35° at night. Care is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> taken to give them sufficient watering, and in their whole
    management to subject them as nearly as possible to the
    conditions of open culture. When the green-fly appears,
    it is immediately destroyed by fumigation with tobacco,
    and the plants are subsequently syringed with clean water.
    With this management, they soon begin to show
    signs of life, the bud commences pushing forth its delicate,
    light green shoot, the leaves then appear, the plant,
    soon growing with luxuriance, is clothed with rich foliage,
    and about the middle of the third month, the house
    presents a mass of thrifty growth and perfect bloom.</p>
<p>By the means above described, roses may be forced
    into bloom the latter part of winter; and by observing
    some care to bring them into the house at different periods,
    in regular succession, a bloom can be enjoyed through
    all the spring months, until roses bloom in the open
    ground. This process cannot, however, be continued two
    years in succession without weakening the plant; and although,
    if placed in a shady spot, and allowed to rest
    during the summer, it may sufficiently recover to perform
    the same work another year, it is desirable, if possible,
    to have fresh plants, whose strength has not been exhausted
    by the unusual effort attending the production of flowers
    out of season.</p>
<p>The preceding directions apply more particularly to
    late forcing; and although the same means, with an earlier
    application of heat, will produce flowers early in winter,
    yet the true art of early forcing consists in <i>gradually</i> bringing the Rose out of its season; and it is only by this
    mode that thrifty plants and perfect flowers can be produced
    before Christmas.</p>
<p>Two years, and sometimes three, should be employed in
    preparing a Rose for early forcing. Having been prepared
    by digging around it with a sharp spade some two weeks
    previously, the plant should be taken up immediately
    after the first frost, placed in a cold frame a few days, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> harden, and then taken to the green-house or vinery. A
    moderate heat should then be given it, with plenty of
    light and air to prevent its being drawn. The flower-buds
    should be plucked off as soon as they appear, and no
    bloom should be allowed. It will thus make fine growths,
    and can be plunged in the open ground as soon as danger
    of frost has passed in the spring. Here it can remain
    during the summer, to ripen its wood, and will require no
    care except a little watering in dry weather, and an occasional
    taking up and examination, that the roots may not
    push through the hole of the pot, and become fixed in the
    ground, in which case the plants would make too strong
    a growth, and suffer on being removed from the new-made
    root. In October it can be placed in a pot one size
    larger, pruned by thinning out all the weak branches, and
    shortening the strong ones down to two eyes. It should
    then go through the same process as before, carefully
    picking off all the flower-buds, promoting its growth
    until completed, when let it be put in a cold frame until
    all danger of frost is over, and then plunge it in the
    ground to ripen its wood. As its vegetation was started
    a month earlier the last year, it can now be taken up in
    September, repotted and pruned as before, and then taken
    into the green-house. The temperature should then be
    gradually raised to about 55° until the plant has commenced
    growing, and then gradually increased to 65° or 70°, giving
    as much air as can be obtained without lowering the
    temperature.</p>
<p>All useless shoots should be kept down, and all the
    flower-buds taken off that threaten to be abortive. In
    fumigating for the green-fly, care should be taken not to
    do it too strongly, but repeated and gentle doses at night
    are better. We have known many fine plants ruined by
    fumigation in the hands of an inexperienced person. A
    good bloom can be obtained the second year by this mode;
    but if the amateur has the patience to wait until a third,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> he will be rewarded by a thrifty and compact habit, rich
    foliage, and beautiful bloom for two months before Christmas;
    and if there are a number of plants to be brought
    into the green-house a week after each other, he can have
    them in bloom until the late forced roses appear. At all
    periods subsequent to their commencement, care should
    be taken to give them sufficient moisture, and as much air
    as is consistent with the state of growth and the external
    temperature. Without water, they will neither grow nor
    bloom well. Under glass, every other day, and in some
    cases, twice a week is sufficient.</p>
<p>The great principle to be borne in mind in forcing roses
    is, that sudden excitement is fatal, and that a plant should
    never be taken from the open ground into a heated house
    without being gradually prepared for it. This principle
    is particularly applicable to deciduous roses. The Remontant
    and Bourbon, the Bengal and its sub-classes,
    which grow and bloom through the whole year, are not
    so liable to be injured by exciting treatment.</p>
<p>Cuttings of these that are struck in the spring and
    planted out in the open ground may have their tops
    slightly pruned, and their buds all pinched off during the
    summer, to encourage the formation of wood and of a
    close head.</p>
<p>About the last days of summer, or the first of autumn,
    they can be taken up and placed in quart pots, with a soil
    composed of one half loam, one quarter cow-dung, and
    one quarter peat. After being slightly pruned, and left
    in the shade for a week, they can be placed in frames,
    protected at night from frost, and exposed to the air in
    mild weather for some two months, when they can be removed,
    a few at a time, into the green-house, and subjected
    to a moderately increased temperature. They will
    soon bloom well, and will succeed each other throughout
    the winter and spring, until roses bloom in the open air.
    Like the deciduous roses, they require to be protected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> against the green-fly by syringing, and if that does not
    answer, by fumigation with tobacco.</p>
<p>The Bengal, however, like the deciduous roses, will
    bloom better the second winter than the first, by shifting
    them into larger pots, pruning them, cutting off all the
    flower-buds, and giving them very little water the latter
    part of summer. They can then be put into the frames,
    and treated as before. The Bengal Rose is very easily
    forced in this way; and if the temperature is at first kept
    during the day at 45°, and gradually increased to 60°,
    there can be little difficulty in obtaining beautiful and
    healthy plants. This temperature can be obtained in any
    green-house or vinery. The latter is becoming more
    common, and when it is provided with heating apparatus,
    there can be nothing better for roses. We have
    forced them very successfully in one of our own vineries,
    one hundred and twenty feet long, twelve feet wide, ten
    feet high in the rear, three and a half in front, and heated
    by hot water. But as there may be many who desire
    a cheaper structure, we will give the description of one
    used by Rivers, (the best rose-grower known), with his
    mode of managing roses in a structure of that character.
    &ldquo;A pit, ten or twelve feet long, and eight feet wide, just
    high enough to stand upright in, with a door at one end,
    and a sunken path in the centre, a raised bed on each side
    of the path, and an 18-inch Arnott&rsquo;s stove at the farther
    end, opposite to the door, with a pipe leading into a small
    brick chimney outside, (a chimney is indispensable), will
    give a great abundance of forced roses from February to
    the end of May. To ensure this, a supply must be kept
    ready, so that, say twenty may be placed in the forcing
    pit about the middle of December, a like number in the
    middle of January, and the same about the middle of
    February; they must not be pruned till taken into the
    house, when each shoot should be cut back to two or three
    buds for the formation of strong shoots. The fire should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> be lighted at seven in the morning, and suffered to burn
    out about the same hour in the evening, unless in frosty
    weather, when it must be kept burning till late at night,
    so as to exclude the frost; and for this purpose, double
    mats should be placed on the lights. The thermometer
    should not, by <i>fire heat</i>, be higher in the day than 70°
    during December, January, and February; at night it may
    sink to 35° without injury. The temporary rise in a sunny
    day is of no consequence, but <i>no air must be admitted
    at such times, or the plants will exhaust themselves, and
    immediately shed their leaves</i>. When the sun begins to
    have power, and in sunny weather, toward the end of
    February, the plants may be syringed every morning
    about 10 o&rsquo;clock with tepid water, and smoked with tobacco
    at night on the least appearance of the Aphis, or
    green-fly. To ensure a fine and full crop of flowers, the
    plants should be established one year in pots, and plunged
    in tan or sawdust, in an open, exposed place, that their
    shoots may be well ripened; the pots must be often removed,
    or, what is better, place the pots on slates, to prevent
    their roots striking into the ground. With the Remontant
    or Perpetuals, even if only potted in November
    previous, a very good crop of flowers may often be obtained,
    and a second crop better than the first; for the
    great advantage of forcing Remontant roses is, that after
    blooming in the green-house or drawing-room, their young
    shoots may be cut down to within two or three buds of
    their base, and the plants placed again in the forcing-house,
    and a second crop of flowers obtained. The same
    mode may be followed also with the Bourbon, China, and
    tea-scented roses; with the latter, indeed, a third crop
    may be often obtained. Toward the end of March, when
    the second crop of flowers is coming on, the plants may
    be gradually inured to the air, by opening the sashes in
    mild weather. This will make them hardy and robust.
    Syringing should be practiced every morning and evening;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> but when the flower-buds are ready to open, this
    must be confined to the stems of the plants and the pots;
    otherwise the flowers will be injured by the moisture.
    Air must at first only be given about noon; care must be
    taken to remove the plants from the forcing-house to the
    green-house or drawing-room before their blossoms expand;
    they may then be kept in beauty many days. We
    have not found the check which the plants receive by this
    sudden change of temperature at all detrimental. During
    their second growth, the plants should be watered once a
    week with manure-water, and the surface of the pot occasionally
    stirred. Two pounds of guano to ten gallons of
    water forms the very best species of liquid manure; this
    should be stirred before it is used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The treatment recommended for roses in a pit with
    Arnott&rsquo;s stove may be pursued with roses in a house with
    smoke-flues or hot-water pipes. Arnott&rsquo;s stove is recommended
    as an economical and eligible mode of heating,
    practiced here to some extent with success for several
    years. On these stoves an iron pan, fitted to the top,
    should always be kept full of water. Roses may be
    forced slowly, but with perhaps greater certainty by the
    uninitiated, by giving air freely and constantly in mild
    weather during the day, keeping the fire constantly burning
    during the same period, as recommended when keeping
    them closely shut up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have copied the whole of this article, although in
    a measure a repetition of previous remarks, since it may
    be interesting to some to know the opinion of so eminent
    a cultivator on this least understood branch of rose culture.
    A few of his directions are somewhat different from
    those we have given before, and may be far better than
    our own plan, in the climate of England. Here, an
    Arnott&rsquo;s stove would scarcely heat a pit to 70° with the
    thermometer at zero; and if it should, we would think it
    rather dangerous to give so high a temperature at once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> The strength of guano is also so varied, that we should
    feel very cautious in using it according to the above receipt.
    While, however, we would not venture to question
    the general utility of his directions, we may perhaps
    say, that we have found our own plan effective in its results,
    and productive of thrifty plants and beautiful flowers.
    We would advise cultivators to test them both, and
    adopt that which succeeds best in their hands. A pit of
    the above description can be constructed at a very low
    price, and should be found on the premises of every gentleman
    of even very moderate income, for the supply of
    his parlors during winter. If, in addition to this, there
    were constructed on the east side of the house, and facing
    south, a little room with a glass front and roof, opening
    into the parlor, and heated either by a valve from the
    house furnace, or by a water-back connected with the
    parlor grate, more enjoyment would be afforded the lover
    of flowers than could be obtained by any other outlay of
    two hundred dollars. This room could then be kept constantly
    filled with roses from the pit, and through the
    most dreary winter, amid rain, snow, and storm, would
    present a bright array of the living reminders of spring
    and summer. It is a matter of much surprise, that,
    among all the beautiful country residences in the vicinity
    of our large cities, surrounded by all the appliances of
    luxury and comfort that taste and wealth can afford, so
    few instances are found in which the drawing-room or
    parlor opens into a green-house or conservatory. These
    buildings are frequently placed at a distance from the
    house, and although they may be filled with the most
    beautiful and rare exotics, are, during the greater part of
    the winter, inaccessible to the ladies of the family.</p>
<p>Let gentlemen of wealth, then, place their vineries anywhere,
    but use them as forcing-houses when the vines are
    in a dormant state. Let them also have a green-house
    or conservatory opening from the drawing-room, into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> which all the plants can be brought from the vinery
    whenever they show signs of bloom. This conservatory
    can be heated by hot water, flowing through iron
    pipes from a boiler placed over the furnace that warms
    the drawing-room&mdash;taking from this very little heat, and
    yet abundantly warming the conservatory. An improvement
    could still farther be made, by having the east end
    of the conservatory arch over a carriage drive, and thus
    allow visitors to enter the drawing-room through the conservatory.
    Exclusive of the delight afforded visitors by
    this very pleasant addition to a dwelling, it affords a delightful
    promenade for the ladies of the family, where,
    while all is wintry without, and walking is unpleasant,
    even when the ice-bound trees are glittering in the clear
    sunlight, they may luxuriate amid roses and jasmines,
    breathing air fragrant with the perfume of daphne and
    orange flowers, and surrounded with everything that can
    remind them of the beauty and bland climate of the sunny
    south.</p>
<p>We have occupied so much space with the peculiarities
    of culture for the forcing-house, that we had almost forgotten
    that more humble, but no less pleasure-giving
    mode of Window culture. As this culture is practiced
    chiefly by those who cannot spare the time nor incur the
    expense of previous preparation, the best mode is that
    given for late forcing of roses, taken up the autumn previous,
    placing the plants in pots seven inches in diameter,
    and using a soil composed of equal parts of sand, loam,
    and manure, or peat, loam, and manure. They can be
    watered with manure-water every fortnight, made from
    the drippings of the barn-yard, or, what is more pleasant,
    a safely weak solution of guano, about one pound to fifteen
    gallons.</p>
<p>The plants should be brought into the heat gradually;
    first into a cold room where there is no frost, and then
    into the sitting-room, where they can be placed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> window, and turned around every week, in order to give
    each side of the plant its share of light. They will soon
    begin to put forth their thrifty shoots, in some six weeks
    will present a fine show of beautiful flowers, and, if properly
    managed, will continue blooming through the winter.
    If attacked by the green-fly, the plant can be inverted in
    a strong decoction of tobacco, or it can be fumigated by
    being placed under an inverted barrel, or other receptacle,
    with some burning tobacco. For window culture,
    the Everblooming Roses are the best, and they
    should be ordered of the nurseryman in suitable pots.
    This mode commends itself to all; it is within the reach
    of the daily laborer; the seamstress can have it in her
    window, and in the midst of her toilsome duties, be reminded
    by its bright flowers of many a green spot in
    past days. It is especially suited to the means and leisure
    of the operatives in our factories, many of whom have
    left the country and all its green fields and pleasant flowers
    for the crowded city, where they can have no garden,
    but simply this little pot to remind them of past pleasures,
    and throw a gleam of sunshine over their hours of relief
    from labor. The plant can be placed in their chamber
    window, or in the windows of the factory, where the high
    temperature, if it has been brought from the chamber,
    will soon bring out its foliage in great luxuriance, and its
    flowers in beauty, and be a pleasant object of care in the
    moments snatched from the operations of the loom. To
    this class we would especially commend the Rose; as
    thriving under simple treatment, as possessing, more than
    any other flower, the elements of beauty, and tending,
    like other flowers, to keep alive in a crowded city that
    freshness and purity of feeling that distinguished their country life, and which, unless there exists an unusual
    perversion of the moral faculties, must always result
    from an intimate acquaintance with natural objects.</p>

<h3>PROPAGATION OF THE ROSE.</h3>
<p class="center">CUTTINGS.</p>
<p>This mode of propagation, although possible with all
    roses, is more difficult with those that bloom only once in
    the season. It is most applicable to the smooth-wooded
    kinds, as the Bengal and its sub-classes, and the Boursault,
    Microphylla, rubifolia, etc. Many of the Perpetuals
    and Bourbons are propagated with facility by the same
    mode. For propagation in the open ground, cuttings
    should be made in the autumn, or early part of winter.
    They should be made of wood of the growth of the season,
    and about six inches long. The lower end should be
    cut square, close to a bud, and they can then be planted
    thickly, two-thirds of their length in sand, in a light and
    dry cellar. Here a callus will be formed on the bottom
    of each cutting during the winter, and on being planted
    out in the spring, they will immediately throw out roots.
    They should be planted as early as possible in the spring,
    in a light sandy loam, with one-third of their length and
    at least one bud above the surface of the ground. They
    should be planted very early in the spring, because, if left
    until late, the power of the sun is too much for them.
    The earth should be trodden down very tight about them,
    in order, as much as possible, to exclude the air. If the
    weather is dry, they should be carefully watered in the
    evening. Where it is inconvenient to make the cuttings
    in the fall or early in the winter, they can be made in the
    spring; but in consequence of having to form the callus,
    they will require a much lighter soil than will afterward
    be desirable for their growth, and they will also be much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> later in coming on. This mode of open propagation answers
    very well for some of the smooth-wooded roses of
    the more robust growing varieties, like the Boursault and
    Rubifolia; but for the delicate Bengals, the best mode is
    pot propagation. For this purpose, small pots can be
    used, filled with equal parts of mould and sand, or peat
    and sand. About the middle of autumn, cuttings of the
    same season&rsquo;s growth
    are taken off with two
    to four buds, cutting
    off one or two of the
    lower leaves, and cutting
    off the wood smooth
    and square close to
    the eye, as in figure 8.
    These cuttings can be
    inserted in the pot, leaving
    one eye above the
    surface. It should then
    be slightly watered to
    settle the soil firmly
    around the cuttings, and
    then placed in a cold
    frame, or on the floor of a vinery, in which no fire is
    kept during winter. Early in the spring the pot should
    be placed in a house with a moderate temperature, kept
    perfectly close, and sprinkled every morning with water
    a little tepid. Now, as well as during the autumn, they
    should be shaded from the too bright glare of the sun.
    In about a fortnight, and after they have formed a third
    set of leaves and good roots, a little air can be given
    them; and after being thus hardened for a week, they can
    be repotted into larger pots. In order to ascertain when
    they are sufficiently rooted, the ball of earth can be taken
    out of the pot, by striking its inverted edge lightly against
    some body, at the same time sustaining the ball of earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> by the hand, the cutting being passed between two of the
    fingers a little separated. If well rooted, the fibres will
    be seen on the outside of the ball of earth. They can
    then be placed in a cold frame, or anywhere under glass,
    to be planted out the latter part of spring, or retained
    for pot culture. Where hot-bed frames are not convenient,
    or the amateur wishes only to experiment with one
    or two cuttings, he can use a tumbler, or any kind of
    close glass covering.</p>

    <div class="caption"> Fig. 8.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A ROSE CUTTING.</span></div>

<p>Where roses are forced into bloom the latter part of
    winter, cuttings can be taken from them immediately after
    the bloom is past; and they will also succeed if taken
    from plants in the open ground immediately after their
    first bloom. Cuttings of the Everblooming Roses will
    all strike at any time during the summer, but they succeed
    much better either in the autumn, or after their first
    bloom. The heat of our midsummer sun is so great upon
    plants forced in the house, that cuttings often fail at that
    time. When a cutting is made near the old stem, it is
    better to take with it a portion of the old wood, which
    forms the enlarged part of the young branch. Where the
    cuttings are scarce, two buds will answer very well&mdash;one
    below the surface; and, in some cases, propagation has
    been successful with only one eye. In this case they are
    planted up to the base of the leaf in pots of sand, similar
    to that used in the manufacture of glass, and the eye is
    partially covered. They are then subject to the same
    treatment as the others, and carefully shaded; they will
    thus root easily, but require a long time to make strong
    plants.</p>
<p>Some years since, Lecoq, a French cultivator, conceived
    the idea of endeavoring to propagate roses by the leaf.
    He gathered some very young leaves of the Bengal rose,
    about one quarter developed, cutting them off at their
    insertion, or at the surface of the bark. He planted these
    in peat soil, in one-inch pots, and then plunged the pots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> into a moderate heat. A double cover of bell glasses
    was then placed over them, to exclude the air entirely,
    which course of treatment was pursued until they had
    taken root. The shortest time in which
    this could be accomplished was eight
    weeks, and the roots were formed in the
    following manner. First, a callus was
    formed at the base of the leaf, from which
    small fibres put forth; a small bud then
    appeared on the upper side (figure 9); a
    stalk then arose from this bud, which
    finally expanded into leaves and formed
    a perfect plant.</p>

        CUTTING.</span></div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>An English writer remarks, that &ldquo;the
    leaves or leaflets of a rose will often take
    root more freely than even cuttings, and
    in a much shorter time, but these uniformly
    refuse to make buds or grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This experiment is certainly very curious,
    and evinces how great, in the vegetable
    kingdom, are the powers of nature for the maintenance
    of existence, and is one of those singular results
    which should lead us to make farther experiments with
    various parts of plants, and teach us that in Horticulture
    there is yet a wide field for scientific research.</p>
<p>A favorite mode of propagation with some nurserymen
    is from soft wood of plants forced in the winter. Many
    fail entirely in this for want of knowledge of the right
    condition in which the wood should be before cutting, a
    condition which cannot be described on paper. Some varieties,
    like Persian Yellow, will not strike at all, or with
    great difficulty in this way.</p>
<p>The plants from which these cuttings are to be taken
    should be prepared and treated as in the preceding chapter.
    In February and March the cuttings are made and
    inserted in sand, either in pots or benches, in a house of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> the same temperature as that in which the parent plant
    has grown. These pots or benches would be better covered
    with glass, but it is not essential. After the cuttings
    have rooted, they can be potted into small pots, and
    placed in a house of moderate temperature. About the
    middle of May they can be taken out of these pots and
    planted in the open ground.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">BY LAYERS.</p>
<p>This mode is more particularly applicable to those roses
    that bloom only once in the year, and which do not strike
    freely from cuttings, although it can be equally well applied
    to all the smooth-wooded kinds. It can be performed
    at midsummer and for several weeks afterward, and
    should be employed only in those cases where young
    shoots have been formed at least a foot long and are well
    matured. The soil should be well dug around the plant,
    forming a little raised bed of some three feet in diameter,
    with the soil well pulverized and mixed with some manure
    thoroughly decomposed, and, if heavy, a little sand. A
    hole should then be made in this bed about four inches
    deep, and the young matured shoot bent down into it,
    keeping the top of the shoot some three or four inches
    above the surface of the ground; the angle thus being
    found, which should always be made at a bud and about
    five or six inches from the top of the shoot, the operator
    should cut off all the leaves below the ground. A sharp
    knife should then be placed just below a bud, about three
    inches below the surface of the ground, and a slanting cut
    made upward and lengthwise, about half through the
    branch, forming a sort of tongue from one to two inches
    long, on the back part of the shoot right opposite the bud;
    a chip or some of the soil can be placed in the slit, to prevent
    it from closing, and the shoot can then be carefully
    laid in the hole, and pegged down at a point some two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> inches below the cut, keeping, at the same time, the top
    of the shoot some three or four inches out of the ground,
    and making it fast to a small stake, to keep it upright.
    Care should be taken not to make the angle where the
    branch is pegged at the cut, as the branch would be injured
    and perhaps broken off; the best place is about two
    inches below the incision. The soil can then be replaced
    in the hole, and where it is convenient covered with some
    moss or litter of any kind. This will protect the soil
    from the sun and keep it moist, and will materially aid
    the formation of new roots. These are formed in the same
    manner as in cuttings; first a callus is produced on those
    parts of the incision where the bark joins the wood, and
    from this callus spring the roots, which, in some cases,
    will have grown sufficiently for the layers to be taken
    from the parent plant the latter part of the following autumn;
    in some cases, however, the roots will not have
    sufficiently formed to allow them to be taken up before
    another year. The summer is the best period for layering
    the young shoots. Early in the spring, layers can be
    made with the wood formed the previous year. Where
    it is more convenient, a shoot can be rooted by making
    the incision as above, and introducing it into a quart pot
    with the bottom partly broken out. This pot can be
    plunged in the ground, or if the branch is from a standard,
    it can be raised on a rough platform. In either case,
    it should be covered with moss, to protect it from the sun,
    and should be watered every evening. We recollect seeing
    in the glass manufactories of Paris, a very neat little
    glass tumbler, used by the French gardeners for this purpose.
    It held, perhaps, half a pint, and a space about
    half an inch wide was cut out through the whole length of the side, through which space the branch of any plant
    was inserted, and the tumbler then filled with soil. When
    the roots were formed and began to penetrate the soil,
    they could be easily perceived through the glass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> Although an incision is always the most certain, and it is
    uniformly practiced, roots will in many varieties strike
    easily from the buds; and a common operation in France
    is simply to peg down the branches in the soil, without
    any incision; in some cases, they give the branch a sudden
    twist, which will break or bruise the bark, and facilitate
    the formation of roots.</p>
<p>Some Chinese authors state that very long branches
    may be laid down, and that roots may be thus obtained
    from all the eyes upon them, which will eventually form
    as many plants.</p>
<p>Vibert, a well-known rose cultivator in France, remarks
    upon this point: &ldquo;Upon laying down with the requisite
    care some branches fifteen to twenty-four inches long, of
    the new growth, or of that of the previous year, and upon
    taking them up with similar care, after twelve or
    eighteen months, I found only the first eyes expanded into
    buds or roots, while the rest had perished. I have seldom
    seen the fifth eye developed, while I have frequently
    known the whole branch entirely perish. I speak in general
    terms, for there are some rare exceptions, and the
    different varieties of the Four-seasons Rose may be cited
    as proof that a great number of eyes of the same branch
    have taken root.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the opinion of an eminent rose grower; but if,
    as he states, the Monthly Damask Rose will root freely in
    this way, many of the smooth-wooded roses would undoubtedly
    root still more readily, and our rapid growing
    native rose, Queen of the Prairies, would very probably
    throw out roots readily, when treated in this manner. It
    is worth repeated experiment; for, if rapid growing roses,
    like some of the evergreen varieties, the Greville, and the
    Queen of the Prairies, could with facility be made to grow
    in this way, rose hedges could be easily formed by laying
    down whole branches, and a very beautiful and effective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> protection would be thus produced, to ornament our fields
    and gardens.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">SUCKERS.</p>
<p>Many roses throw up suckers readily from the root, and
    often form one of the principal causes of annoyance to the
    cultivator. For this reason, budding and grafting should
    always be done on stocks that do not incline to sucker.
    The Dog Rose&mdash;on which almost all the imported varieties
    are now worked&mdash;is particularly liable to this objection,
    and it is no unusual thing to see half-a-dozen suckers
    growing about a single rose-tree. When the health and
    prosperity of the plant are desired, these should be carefully
    kept down, as they deprive the plant of a material
    portion of its nourishment. When, however, they are
    wanted for stocks, they should be taken off every spring
    with a small portion of root, which can generally be obtained
    by cutting some distance below the surface of the
    ground. They should be planted immediately where they
    are wanted for budding, and will soon be fit for use.
    Many fine varieties of the summer roses will sucker in this
    way, and an old plant when taken up will sometimes furnish
    a large number of thrifty stems, each with a portion
    of root attached.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">BUDDING.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, budding and grafting were very little
    practiced, excepting with new varieties, that could with
    great difficulty be propagated in any other way. Within
    that time, however, the practice has been constantly increasing
    until now, when it is extensively employed in
    Europe, and roses imported from France and England can
    very rarely be obtained on their own roots. To this mode
    of propagation, there is one great objection, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> advantages in some varieties are sufficiently great to counterbalance
    any inconveniences attending the cultivation of
    a budded or grafted rose. It is generally the case, that
    the stock or plant on which the Rose is budded is of
    some variety that will throw up suckers very freely, which
    growing with great luxuriance, will sometimes overpower
    the variety budded upon it, and present a mass of its own
    flowers. The purchaser will thus find a comparatively
    worthless bloom, instead of the rare and beautiful varieties
    whose appearance he has been eagerly awaiting, and upon
    the head of the nurseryman will frequently descend the
    weight of his indignation. This difficulty can, however, be
    avoided by a very little attention. The shoot of the stock
    can very readily be distinguished from that of the budded or
    grafted variety by its growth and foliage, even if the age
    of the plant will not allow the point of inoculation to be
    recognized. In passing the plant in his walks, let the
    owner simply cut away any shoot of this character that
    may spring from the stock or root. The budded variety
    thus receiving all the nourishment from the root, will soon
    grow with luxuriance, and present to the eager expectant
    as fine a bloom as he may desire&mdash;at the expense only of
    a little observation, and the trouble of occasionally taking
    his knife from his pocket.</p>
<p>This trouble, however, is such that the plant is in most
    cases neglected. Budded or grafted roses are thus very
    unpopular in this country, and those on their own roots
    are deemed the only ones which it is safe to plant.</p>
<p>The practice of budding has brought into cultivation a
    form of the plant which is highly ornamental, but which
    can never become very general in this country. The Tree
    Rose is an inoculation upon a standard some four or five
    feet in height, generally a Dog Rose or Eglantine. The
    tall, naked stem, a greater part of which is unsheltered
    by any foliage, is exposed to the full glare of our summer
    sun, and unless protected in some way, will often die out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> in two or three years. Its life can be prolonged by covering
    the stem with moss, or with a sort of tin tube, provided
    with small holes, to allow the air to enter and circulate
    around the stem. This is, however, some trouble;
    and as many will not provide this protection, a large part
    of the standard roses imported to this country will gradually
    die out, and rose <i>bushes</i> be generally employed for
    single planting, or for grouping upon the lawn.</p>
<p>In budding, there are two requisites: a well-established
    and thriftily growing plant, and a well-matured eye or
    bud. The operation can be performed at any season when
    these requisites can be obtained. In the open ground, the
    wood from which the buds are cut is generally not mature
    until after the first summer bloom.</p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Having ascertained by running a knife under the bark,
    that the stock will
    peel easily, and having
    some perfectly ripe
    young shoots with
    buds upon them, the
    operation can be performed
    with a sharp
    knife that is round and
    very thin at the point.
    Make in the bark of
    the stock a longitudinal
    incision of three-quarters
    of an inch,
    and another short one
    across the top, as in <i>a</i>, <a href="#Fig._10">fig. 10</a>; run the knife
    under the bark and
    loosen it from the
    wood; then cut from
    one of the young shoots of the desired variety, a bud, as
    in <i>b</i>; placing the knife a quarter to three-eighths of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> inch above the eye or bud, and cutting out about the same
    distance below it, cutting sufficiently near the bud to take
    with it a very thin scale of the wood. English gardeners
    will always peel off this thin scale; but in our hot climate,
    it should always be left on, as it assists to keep the
    bud moist, and does not at all prevent the access of the
    sap from the stock to the bud. The bud being thus prepared,
    take it, by the portion of leaf-stalk attached, between
    the thumb and finger in the left hand, and, with the knife
    in the right, open
    the incision in the
    bark sufficiently to
    allow the bud to be
    slipped in as far as
    it will go, when the
    bark will close over
    and retain it. Then
    take a mat-string, or
    a piece of yarn, and
    firmly bind it around
    the bud, leaving only
    the petiole and bud
    exposed, as in <i>c</i>, <a href="#Fig._10">fig. 10</a>. The string
    should be allowed
    to remain for about
    two weeks, or until
    the bud is united to
    the stock. If allowed
    to remain longer,
    it will sometimes cut
    into the bark of the rapidly growing stock, but is productive
    of no other injury. It is the practice with many cultivators
    to cut off the top of the stock above the bud immediately
    after inoculation. A limited acquaintance with vegetable
    physiology would convince the cultivator of the injurious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> results of this practice, and that the total excision of the
    branches of the stock while in full vegetation must be destructive
    to a large portion of the roots, and highly detrimental
    to the prosperity of the plant. A much better mode
    is to bend down the top, and tie its extremity to the lower
    part of the stock. Several days after this is done, the bud
    can be inserted just below the sharpest bend of the arch.
    When the buds are to be placed in the branches of a
    stock, as in <a href="#Fig._11">fig. 11</a>, the top of the main stem can be cut
    off, and the branches
    arched over and tied
    to the main stem, as at <i>f</i>; the bud is then inserted
    in each branch,
    as at <i>c</i>. The circulation
    of the sap being
    thus impeded by the
    bending of the branches,
    it is thrown into the
    inoculation, and forms
    then a more immediate
    union than it would if
    the branches were not
    arched. After the
    buds have become
    fairly united to the
    stock and have commenced
    growing, the
    top can be safely cut
    off to the bud, although
    it would be still better to make the pruning of the top
    proportionate to the growth of the bud; by this means, a
    slower, but more healthy vegetation is obtained. When
    the buds are inserted very late in the season, it is better
    not to cut off the top of the stock or branches until the
    following spring, and to preserve the bud dormant. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> allowed to make a rapid growth so late in the season,
    there would be great danger of its being killed by frost.
    European cultivators are very fond of budding several varieties
    on one stock, in order to obtain the pretty effect
    produced by a contrast of color. This will only answer
    where great care is taken to select varieties of the same
    vegetating force; otherwise one will soon outstrip the
    others, and appropriate all the nourishment. It is also desirable
    that they should belong to the same species. When
    a bud is inserted in a plant in pot, as in <a href="#Fig._12">fig. 12</a>, the main
    branches are left, and a portion of the top only cut off, in
    order to give the bud some additional nourishment.</p>
<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">GRAFTING.</p>
<p>From the pithy nature of the wood of the Rose, grafting
    is always less certain than budding; but it is frequently
    adopted by cultivators, as budding cannot be relied upon
    in the spring, and as there is much wood from the winter
    pruning which would be otherwise wasted. It is also
    useful for working over those plants in which buds have
    missed the previous summer.</p>
<p>There are several modes of grafting, of which the most
    generally practiced is <i>cleft-grafting</i>. For this mode, the
    stock is cut off at the desired height with a sharp knife,
    either horizontally, or slightly sloping. The cut should
    be made just above a bud, which may serve to draw up the
    sap to the graft. The stock can then be split with a heavy
    knife, making the slit or cleft about an inch long. The
    cion should be about four inches long, with two or more
    buds upon it. An inch of the lower part of the cion can
    be cut in the shape of a wedge, making one side very
    thin, and on the thick or outer side, leaving a bud opposite
    to the top of the wedge. This cion can then be inserted
    in the cleft as far as the wedge is cut, being very
    careful to make the bark of the cion fit exactly to that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> the stock. In order to exclude the air, the top and side
    of the stock should then be bound with a strip of cloth
    covered with a composition of beeswax and resin in equal
    parts, with sufficient tallow to make it soft at a reasonably
    low temperature. In the course of two or three weeks,
    if every thing is favorable, the cion will begin to unite,
    and will be ready to go forward with advancing vegetation.
    When the stock is sufficiently large, two cions can
    be inserted, as in <a href="#Fig._13">fig. 13</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Whip-grafting</i> is performed by cutting a slice of bark
    with a little wood from the side of a stock about an inch
    and a half long, and then paring a cion of the usual length
    down to a very thin lower extremity, as in <a href="#Fig._14">fig. 14</a>. This cion can then be accurately fitted on to the place from which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> the slice of bark and wood is taken. The whole can then
    be bound around with cotton cloth, covered with the
    composition described before. In all grafting it should
    be borne in mind, that it is essential for the bark of the
    cion and that of the stock to touch each other in some
    point, and the more the points of contact, the greater
    will be the chance of success.</p>
<p><i>Rind-grafting</i> is also sometimes practiced, but is more
    uncertain than the former, as the swelling of the stock is
    very apt to force the cion
    out. This mode must be
    practiced when the bark
    peels easily, or separates
    with ease from the wood.
    The top of the stock must
    be cut off square, and the
    bark cut through from the
    top about an inch downward.
    The point of the
    knife can then be inserted
    at the top, and the bark
    peeled back, as in <i>a</i>, <a href="#Fig._15">fig. 15</a>.
    It is desirable, as before,
    that a bud should be left on
    the other side of the stock,
    opposite this opening; and
    the French prefer, also, to have a bud left on the outside
    of the part of the cion which is inserted. The cion should
    be cut out and sloped flat on one side, as in <i>b</i>, <a href="#Fig._15">fig. 15</a>; then
    inserted in the stock between the bark and wood, as in <i>c</i>,
    and bound with mat-strings, or strips of grafting cloth.</p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The French have another mode of grafting stocks about
    the size of a quill or the little finger. It is done by placing
    the knife about two inches below a bud which is just
    on the point of starting, and cutting half way through
    the stock, and two inches down, as in <a href="#Fig._16">fig. 16</a>. The cion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> is then placed in the lower part of this cavity, in the same
    manner as with cleft grafting. This mode is called <i>Aspirant</i>, from the bud above the incision, which continues
    to draw up the sap, until the development of
    the cion. When the cion has grown about two
    inches, the top of the stock is cut off and covered
    with grafting wax. This mode is not always
    successful, as the sap sometimes leaves the side
    of the stock which has been partly cut away
    and passes up the other side.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;"> <img src="images/i128.jpg" width="100" height="468" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"> <a name="Fig._16" id="Fig._16">Fig. 16</a>.</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The French have also a mode of grafting,
    which they call <i>par incrustation</i>, and which is
    performed in the spring, as soon as the leaf-buds
    appear. A cion with a bud adhering to the wood
    is cut in a sort of oval shape, and inserted in a
    cavity made of the same shape, and just below
    an eye which has commenced growing. It is then
    bound around with matting, as in budding. This
    is a sort of spring budding, with rather more wood
    attached to the bud, than in summer budding. It
    is very successfully practiced by various cultivators in the
    vicinity of Paris. There is still another mode sometimes
    practiced in France, which owes its origin to a cultivator
    named Lecoq. A small branch is chosen, which is provided
    with two buds, one of them being on the upper part, and
    the other near its larger end. A sidelong sloping cut is
    made all along its lower half, the upper being left entire.
    When the cion is thus prepared, its cut side is fitted to
    the side of the stock under the bark, which has been cut
    and peeled back. It is then bound around with mat-strings
    or grafting cloth in the usual way. This mode
    has a peculiar merit; should the upper bud not grow, the
    lower one rarely fails, and develops itself as in common
    budding.</p>
<p>Cleft and whip-grafting is also practiced occasionally
    upon the roots of the Rose, and succeeds very well with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> some varieties. These modes of grafting can all be more
    successfully practiced on stocks in pots in green-houses
    with bottom heat and bell glasses. We have given
    thus concisely, and, we hope, clearly, the various modes of
    budding and grafting with which we are acquainted.
    They may be sufficient to enable the amateur to amuse
    his leisure hours, though his success may not entirely meet
    his expectations. Simple as these operations are, they
    require a kind of skill, and, if we may so call it, sleight-of-hand,
    which is only attained by constant practice upon
    a great number of plants.</p>

<h3>MULTIPLICATION BY SEED AND HYBRIDIZING.</h3>
<p>We have described, in former pages, the various modes
    of cultivating the Rose, and of propagating the many
    beautiful varieties which exist, and would now briefly advert
    to a mode of developing still farther the beauty
    which lies hid within the horny covering that protects the
    dormant germ of vitality&mdash;in other words, of obtaining
    new varieties by seed. With the making of the seed-bed
    commenced a new era in the culture of the Rose, and advancing
    with rapid strides, it made more progress in forty
    years than in centuries before. The Dutch seem to have
    been the first to raise roses from seed, by the same mode
    which they applied successfully to their tulips, hyacinths,
    etc., and from the time that this mode became generally
    employed, the varieties of roses began to increase. In
    this species of cultivation the French soon outstripped
    their Dutch neighbors, and gained the reputation which
    they still retain, of preëminent skill in the production of
    new varieties of roses from the seed.</p>
<p>From 1805 to 1810, the Empress Josephine, whose love
    for flowers is well known, collected at her favorite residence,
    Malmaison, the choicest varieties of the Rose that
    could be obtained from Holland, Germany, and Belgium,
    and thus gave an increased impulse to the culture of roses
    in the vicinity of Paris.</p>
<p>According to De Pronville, a French writer, there were,
    in 1814, only 182 varieties of roses, and the advantage of
    multiplication by seed is sufficiently evinced by the fact
    that there are now more than 6,000 varieties, the poorest
    of which are much better than any which existed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> that day. Among the earliest cultivators of roses from
    the seed, were three Frenchmen: Dupont, Vilmorin, and
    Descemet. The former was the gardener of the Empress
    Josephine. When the allied armies entered Paris, in
    1815, the garden of Descemet contained 10,000 seedling
    roses, which Vibert, in his anxiety to secure from destruction,
    succeeded in carrying to his garden in the interior.</p>
<p>In England, very little attention seems, at that time, to
    have been paid to the production of new varieties from seed,
    and the English relied very much upon the continent for
    their choice roses. Now, however, they are abundantly
    redeeming their reputation, and many fine varieties have
    been produced by English rose-growers, at the head of
    whom stands Rivers, whose efforts are seconded by
    Wood, Paul, Lane, and others. They are still, however,
    compelled to yield to the French cultivators; for to these
    we are indebted for our very finest roses&mdash;for Lamarque,
    Solfaterre, La Reine, Chromatella, the new white Perpetuals,
    Souvenir de Malmaison, and others.</p>
<p>The varieties of roses became increasingly great after
    the introduction of the Bengals, Noisettes, Teas, and
    Bourbons&mdash;all these classes producing readily from seed,
    and in endless variety. There still remains a willingness
    to cast aside the old for the new, and however much we
    may regret this disposition, for the sake of some old and
    truly deserving favorites, we cannot feel willing to denounce
    it, for it exhibits a gratifying evidence of a desire
    for improvement, and the existence of a spirit of progress,
    which, dissatisfied with things as they are, is continually
    striving after nearer approaches to perfection. If, in this
    strife, some of our old favorites have been cast aside, we
    are more than abundantly compensated for their loss by
    the new claimants to our regard.</p>
<p>Those who intend to raise new roses from seed should
    select varieties differing as much as possible in color and
    habit, and possessing broad, thick, and well-formed petals;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> their stamens should also be visible, and their pistils
    perfect; for perfectly double flowers, in which all the organs
    of propagation&mdash;the stamens and pistils&mdash;are changed
    into petals, never yield seed. These should be planted
    together in a rich soil, and as far as possible from any
    other roses. If there are among them any two varieties
    whose peculiarities it is desired to unite in a single plant,
    place these next to each other, and there may possibly be
    such an admixture of the pollen as will produce the desired
    result.</p>
<p>Care should be taken not to affect the proper maturity
    of the seed by taking off the petals, but allow them to
    fall by their own decay. The seed should be perfectly
    mature before it is gathered, which will be immediately
    after the first hard frost. After the hips have been gathered,
    the seeds can be taken out with the point of a knife,
    or, if there is a large quantity, they can be put on a table
    and bruised with a wooden roller; the covering of the
    seeds is so tough that they cannot easily be injured.
    When the hip is sufficiently bruised, it can be plunged into
    a vessel of water; and by continued friction, the seeds
    can be easily separated from the pulp which surrounds
    them, and will generally fall to the bottom. After
    being dried a few days in the shade, they should be
    placed just beneath the surface, in pots filled with fine
    sand, or peat earth, where they can be kept until wanted
    for planting in the spring. The seeds which are not thus
    placed in sand soon after they are gathered will not grow
    until the second, and if delayed very long, until the third
    year. In this case, however, their germination can be
    hastened by sowing them in earthen pans, which are
    placed upon a hot-bed or under a glass frame. The seeds
    being thus planted immediately after being gathered, the
    sand should be kept moistened through the winter, and the
    pots put out of the reach of frost. Mice are very fond
    of these seeds, and will destroy them unless they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> protected. The pots should be kept out of all heat, excepting
    what may be required to keep the frost from them,
    until the first of April, in this latitude, and at the South,
    earlier; this is requisite, in order to prevent their germinating
    before all danger of frost is past in the open air.
    At the time the pots or pans are brought from their sheltered
    place into a warm temperature, beds for the plants
    should be made in the open air, that they may be ready
    the moment they are required. For these an eastern aspect
    is the best, and in our hot climate, on the north side
    of a fence would answer very well; if they are in an open
    piece of ground, they should be sheltered by an awning
    from the hot sun. The soil should be a rich, light sandy
    mould, with a little peat, if convenient, and should be
    finely pulverized. The seeds should now be closely watched,
    and the moment they are seen pushing up the sand, in
    order to obtain light, they should be taken out singly with
    the point of a knife, taking a small portion of the sand
    with them. The bed having been previously watered, and
    raked fine, drills can be made, half an inch deep and
    about a foot apart, in which the germinating seeds can be
    placed, at a distance of six inches from each other, and
    then carefully covered with finely pulverized soil. Having
    commenced germinating in the pots, the seeds, now in the
    genial warmth of a spring sun, but protected from its
    fiercest rays, will soon show their heads above the ground,
    and striking deep root in the rich soil, grow rapidly.
    While the plants are small, care should be taken to keep
    the ground constantly moist.</p>
<p>We are aware that this process is somewhat new with
    rose seeds, although it has been long practiced with
    Rhododendrons and other plants, but we are convinced
    of its superiority to the old mode. The delicate roots of
    young plants are very susceptible of injury by change,
    and many are frequently lost by the first potting; this
    risk is avoided by transplanting the seed before the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> root fibre is formed, and when, being in the act of germination,
    there can be no possible danger of its rotting,
    which is frequently a serious objection to sowing seeds at
    once in the open ground. The trouble and risk of loss
    occasioned by subsequent re-pottings are also avoided,
    and the plants have, by this mode, full liberty to grow as
    luxuriantly as they choose, with only the slight attention
    required by watering and shading. As the plan of Rivers
    is materially different, we will give his directions in detail,
    admitting, at the same time, that, under some circumstances,
    it may be preferable to that we have presented
    above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hips of all the varieties of roses, will, in general,
    be fully ripe by the beginning of November; they should
    then be gathered and kept entire, in a flower pot filled
    with dry sand, carefully guarded from mice. In February,
    or by the first week in March, they must be broken
    to pieces with the fingers, and sown in flower pots, such
    as are generally used for sowing seeds in, called &lsquo;seed
    pans&rsquo;; but for rose seeds they should not be too shallow;
    nine inches in depth will be enough. These should be
    nearly, but not quite, filled with a rich compost of rotten
    manure and sandy loam, or peat; the seeds may be covered,
    to the depth of about half an inch, with the same
    compost; a piece of kiln wire must then be placed over
    the pot, fitting closely at the rim, so as to prevent the ingress
    of mice, which are passionately fond of rose seeds;
    there must be space enough between the wire and the
    mould for the young plants to come up&mdash;half an inch will
    probably be found enough; the pots of seed must never
    be placed under glass, but kept constantly in the open air,
    in a full sunny exposure, as the wire will shade the mould
    and prevent its drying. Water should be given occasionally,
    in dry weather. The young plants will perhaps
    make their appearance in April or May, but very often the
    seed does not vegetate until the second spring. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> they have made their &lsquo;rough leaves,&rsquo; that is, when they
    have three or four leaves, they must be carefully raised
    with the point of a narrow pruning-knife, potted into small
    pots, and placed in the shade; if the weather is very hot
    and dry, they may be covered with a hand-glass for a few
    days. They may remain in those pots a month, and then
    be planted out into a rich border; by the end of August
    those that are robust growers will have made shoots long
    enough for budding.&rdquo; Until the plants have become
    firmly rooted, and, in fact, through the most of the first
    summer, they should be protected from the heat of the
    sun; a cheap mode of doing this is to put up rough posts,
    connect them by pieces of wood, lay rough slats across
    these, and cover the whole with straw or cornstalks; but
    a much neater covering is a good canvas awning, supported
    by posts, which can be taken down when not needed,
    and will last many years. The Bourbons and Bengals,
    with the Teas and Noisettes, will sometimes bloom the
    first season; but as the plant will be weak, a correct
    opinion cannot be formed of its character until the second
    summer. The summer roses, or those which bloom only
    once in the season, never show bloom until their third, and
    sometimes not until their fourth and fifth year. It is well
    to let all the plants remain in the seed-bed until the fifth
    year, as some which prove unpromising at first may result
    in something really good. All that prove bad the fifth
    year can be marked for destruction, or cut down to receive
    the buds of the good varieties. In order to obtain a good
    bloom as soon as possible, it is well to have ready some
    strong stocks of the Greville, Mannetti, or any other free-growing
    rose, into which buds can be inserted of any of the
    seedlings whose habit and general appearance promise good
    flowers, and whose growth has been sufficient to furnish
    good buds. The next spring the stock should be cut down
    to the bud, which will then make luxuriant shoots, and
    produce flowers the same season, if an Everblooming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> variety; but if one of the Summer roses, not until the next
    season. The third spring let every branch be cut down
    to three or four eyes, when it will more fully develop its
    character, and will often continue improving until its fifth
    or sixth year.</p>
<p>The first winter, the young plants will require protection
    from the cold by some kind of litter, and the Bengal,
    Tea, and Noisette varieties will always need it during the
    winter. Where there are any plants of these latter, whose
    habit and appearance promise something excellent, they
    can be potted on the approach of winter, kept in a cool
    temperature, free from frost, and replanted in the spring.</p>
<p>When it is desired that the young plant should possess
    the properties of two well-known flowers, resort is had to
    artificial impregnation.</p>
<p>Although the existence of sexuality in plants appears
    to have been known to the ancients, and is mentioned not
    only by Pliny, Claudian, and Theophrastus, but also by
    Ebu-Alwan, in a work on agriculture written originally in
    Chaldaic; yet it does not seem to have been generally admitted
    by botanists, until announced by Linnæus in 1731.
    From this time the possibility of the existence of hybrid
    plants was admitted, and Linnæus, with many subsequent
    authors, published observations tending to show that, even
    in the natural state, new species were formed by two different
    plants, the pistil of one having been fecundated by
    the stamens of the other. This impregnation has been
    artificially applied, by modern cultivators, to the production
    of new varieties of fruits and flowers. With the
    Geranium, Fuchsia, Pæony, Pansy, and other flowers, it
    has produced remarkable results. The mode of impregnating
    the Rose artificially has been so little practiced
    with us, and has been so well described by Rivers, that
    we prefer detailing the process in his own words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it is desirable the qualities of a favorite rose
    should preponderate, the petals of the flower to be fertilized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> must be opened gently with the fingers. A flower
    that will expand in the morning should be opened the
    afternoon or evening previous, and the anthers all removed
    with a pair of pointed scissors. The following morning,
    when this flower is fully expanded, it must be fertilized
    with a flower of some variety of whose qualities it is
    desired to have seedlings largely partake. It requires
    some watchfulness to open the petals at the proper time;
    if too soon, the petals will be injured in forcing them
    open, and in hot weather, in July, if delayed only an hour
    or two, the anthers will be found to have shed their pollen.
    To ascertain precisely when the pollen is in a fit state for
    transmission, a few of the anthers should be gently pressed
    with the finger and thumb; if the yellow dust adheres
    to them, the operation may be performed; it requires close
    examination and some practice to know when the flower
    to be operated upon is in a fit state to receive the pollen;
    as a general rule, the flowers ought to be in the same
    state of expansion, or, in other words, about the same age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To exemplify the process, we will suppose that a
    climbing Moss Rose, with red or crimson flowers, is wished
    for: the flowers of the Blush Ayrshire, which bear
    seed abundantly, may be selected, and before expansion,
    the anthers removed; the following morning, or as soon
    after the operation as these flowers open, they should be
    fertilized with those of the Luxembourg Moss; if the
    operation succeed, seed will be procured, from which, the
    probability is, that a climbing rose will be produced with
    the habit and flowers of the Moss Rose, or at least an approximation
    to them. I mention the union of the Moss
    and Ayrshire Roses by way of illustration, and merely
    to point out to the amateur how extensive and how interesting
    a field of operations is open in this way. I ought
    to give a fact that has occurred in my own experience,
    which will tell better with the sceptical than a thousand
    anticipations. About four years since, in a pan of seedling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> Moss Roses, was one with a most peculiar habit, even
    when very young; this has since proved a hybrid rose,
    partaking much more of the Scotch Rose than of any
    other, and until the plant arrived at full growth, I thought
    it a Scotch Rose, the seed of which had by accident been
    mixed with that of the Moss Rose, although I had taken
    extreme care. To my surprise it has since proved a perfect
    hybrid, having the sepals and the fruit of the Provence
    Rose, with the spiny and dwarf habit of the Scotch Rose;
    it bears abundance of hips, which are all abortive. The
    difference in the fruit of the Moss and Provence Rose, and
    that of the Scotch, is very remarkable; and this it was
    which drew my particular attention to the plant in question.
    It was raised from the same seed, and in the same
    seed-pan, as the single crimson Moss Rose. As this strange
    hybrid came from a Moss Rose accidentally fertilized, we
    may expect that art will do much more for us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only in cases where it is wished for the qualities
    of a particular rose to predominate, that the removal of
    the anthers of the rose to be fertilized is necessary: thus,
    if a yellow climbing rose is desired by the union of the
    Yellow Brier with the Ayrshire, every anther should be
    removed from the latter, so that it is fertilized solely with
    the pollen of the former. In some cases, where it is desirable
    to have the qualities of both parents in an equal
    degree, the removal of the anthers must not take place:
    thus I have found, by removing them from the Luxembourg
    Moss, and fertilizing that rose with a dark variety
    of <i>Rosa Gallica</i>, that the features of the Moss Rose are
    totally lost in its offspring, and they become nearly pure
    varieties of the former; but if the anthers of the Moss
    Rose are left untouched, and it is fertilized with <i>Rosa
    Gallica</i>, interesting hybrids are the result, more or less
    mossy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no branch of rose culture possessing more interest
    for the amateur, with whose leisure its prosecution is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> compatible. The constant care and attention required, in
    order to ensure success, place it in a great measure beyond
    the limits of a large commercial establishment. The
    great desideratum at this time is a double, yellow, climbing
    rose. If the Harrison Rose were fertilized with the
    Queen of the Prairies, or the latter with the Solfaterre or
    Chromatella, a rose might possibly be obtained with the
    rich yellow of the Harrison Rose, and the robust habit
    and beautifully formed flower of the Queen of the Prairies.
    While, however, we recommend this mode of artificial
    impregnation, we would by no means discourage the sowing
    of seeds whose flowers have not thus been fecundated.
    The seed of the Harrison Rose, or of any of the yellow
    roses, may, if perseveringly saved from generation to
    generation, produce a yellow climbing rose. In fact, we
    are inclined to think that among all the reputed hybrids,
    a much less number than is supposed owe their origin to
    a crossed fecundation. It is a fact generally admitted by
    botanists, that all varieties of plants will generally produce
    from their seed plants very dissimilar, preserving,
    perhaps, some peculiarities of their parents, but differing
    in many essential particulars.</p>
<p>It will thus be perceived that, in the simple sowing of
    seeds, where there is a dislike to the trouble of artificial
    impregnation, there is a wide field for experiment and for
    successful result. But to those who have the leisure and
    the patience to transfer from one plant to another its fertilizing
    matter, it forms a pleasant amusement, with rather
    a greater probability of satisfactory results. In either
    case, every amateur of roses should have his seed-plat;
    and if, out of a thousand, or even five thousand roses, he
    should obtain one good variety, and differing from any other
    known, he will be conferring an important service upon
    rose-culture, and will encourage others to pursue the same
    course, until we shall be in no wise behind either France
    or England in this interesting branch of horticulture.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The diseases to which the Rose is liable are generally
    owing either to the presence of various Cryptogamic
    plants, or to the attacks of certain insects whose larvæ
    are supported at the expense of the plant. Among Cryptogamic
    parasites which have been observed upon rose-bushes,
    and which infest chiefly the Provence and other
    rough-leaved roses, the following are the most troublesome:</p>
<p><b>Rust.</b>&mdash;The rust, when examined by a magnifier, is
    found to consist of minute yellow spots, each of which is
    a fungus, <i>Lecythea Rosæ</i>. It is common and injurious to
    roses, as it frequently covers all the leaves. The most effectual
    mode of preventing its spreading is to cut off with
    care and burn all the infected branches, which will sometimes
    render necessary the destruction of the whole plant.</p>
<p><b>Mildew.</b>&mdash;The minute fungus which produces mildew is
    called by botanists <i>Sphærotheca pannosa</i>. It appears like
    a gray mould on the smaller stems and blistered leaves.
    It is a very troublesome enemy to the Rose, and will
    sometimes put at defiance every application for its destruction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> The most effectual is smoking with sulphur, dusting
    with dry flowers of sulphur, or syringing with sulphur water.
    The former should only be practiced by a skillful
    hand, as too much sulphur-smoke will sometimes entirely
    kill the plant.</p>
<p><b>Mould</b> is due to a minute gray fungus, <i>Peronospora
    sparsa</i>, and manifests its presence by the appearance of
    irregular pale brownish spots upon the upper surface of
    the leaf. Upon the under surface of these spots the
    mould will be found.</p>
<p>Other species of fungi attack the Rose, but they are
    not sufficiently troublesome to the cultivator to need
    enumeration here.</p>
<p>The <i>insects</i> which infest the Rose are quite numerous,
    and their attacks are more or less injurious. The majority
    of those which are found on the plant in the state of perfect
    insects are comparatively harmless. The most injurious
    are those whose larvæ feed on the leaves and pith
    of the trunk and limbs, and thus destroy the plant; while
    the perfect insect, like the Green-fly, will simply stop the
    growth and impair the health of the tree, by fastening upon
    the green and tender bark of the young shoots, and
    devouring the sap. It is highly desirable that amateur
    cultivators should devote more time to the study of Entomology,
    for upon an intimate acquaintance with the habits
    of these minute depredators depends, in a greater degree
    than is generally supposed, the success of cultivation.
    Our own leisure is so limited, that we have been able to
    devote very little time to this subject; and we can find
    no work that treats in detail the insects that attack the
    Rose. We simply give some account of the most troublesome
    ones drawn mainly from Harris&rsquo; Insects Injurious to
    Vegetation.</p>
<p><b>Green-Fly</b>, or <b>Plant-Louse</b>.&mdash;<i>Aphis Rosæ.</i>&mdash;This very
    common insect is a scourge to roses, from the facility of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> reproduction, and its numerous progeny sometimes entirely
    cover the leaves, the young sprouts, and the flower
    buds. Devouring the sap, they are very injurious, and,
    when numerous, sometimes destroy the plant, while they
    soil every part on which they collect. The most common
    species is of a pale green, but there is a variety of a dingy
    yellow. Many are destroyed by small birds, but they
    have other enemies, as the larvæ of the <i>Coccinellas</i>, or
    Lady-birds, and other insects destroy large numbers.
    The first eggs of the Green-fly are deposited in the autumn,
    at the base of the buds, and are hatched in the early
    part of the following spring. Generation after generation
    is then rapidly produced, numbering sometimes eight or
    ten before autumn. These are produced alive, and without
    the intervention of the male. Reaumur estimated
    that a single Aphis might produce six thousand millions in
    one summer. The first hatching can be prevented by
    washing the plant with soft soap and water, or with whale-oil
    soap, before the buds commence swelling. When the
    plant is infested with them, it can be washed with tobacco-water
    and then rinsed in clean water. If in a house,
    fumigation with tobacco is better. An English writer
    recommends washing in a decoction of an ounce of quassia
    to a quart of water, as a very effective and safe remedy.
    Fumigation is, however, the must thoroughly searching
    remedy, and can be easily applied to plants in the open
    air, by means of an empty barrel inverted over the plant,
    and a pan of burning tobacco.</p>
<p><b>Gall-Flies.</b>&mdash;Several species of <i>Cynips</i>, or Gall-flies, attack
    the rose, their punctures, made for the purpose of
    depositing their eggs, being followed by variously formed
    excrescences containing the larvæ. The B&eacute;d&eacute;guars, formed
    by the puncture of the <i>Cynips Rosæ</i>, were formerly employed
    in medicine as astringents. Harris enumerates the
    American species as follows:</p>
<p><i>Cynips bicolor.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Round, prickly galls, of a reddish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> color, and rather larger than a pea, may often be seen on
    rose-bushes. Each of them contains a single grub, and
    this in due time turns to a gall-fly. Its head and thorax
    are black, and rough with numerous little pits; its hind-body
    is polished, and, with the legs, of a brownish-red
    color. It is a large insect compared with the size of its
    gall, measuring nearly one-fifth of an inch in length, while
    the diameter of its gall, not including the prickles, rarely
    exceeds three-tenths of an inch.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Cynips dichlocerus</i>, &ldquo;or the gall-fly with two-colored
    antennæ, is of a brownish-red or cinnamon color, with four
    little longitudinal grooves on the top of the thorax, the
    lower part of the antennæ red, and the remainder black.
    It varies in being darker sometimes, and measures from
    one-eighth to three-sixteenths of an inch in length. Great
    numbers of these gall-flies are bred in the irregular woody
    galls, or long excrescences, of the stems of rose-bushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Cynips semipiceus.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;The small roots of rose-bushes,
    and of other plants of the same family, sometimes produce
    rounded, warty, and woody knobs, inhabited by
    numerous gall-insects, which, in coming out, pierce them
    with small holes on all sides. The winged insects closely
    resemble the dark varieties of the preceding species in
    color, and in the little furrows on the thorax; but their
    legs are rather paler, and they do not measure more than
    one-tenth of an inch in length.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Rose-Slug</b>, <i>Selandria Rosæ</i>, of Harris, who gives the
    following account: &ldquo;The saw-fly of the rose, which, as it
    does not seem to have been described before, may be called <i>Selandria Rosæ</i>, from its favorite plant, so nearly resembles
    the slug-worm saw-fly as not to be distinguished
    therefrom except by a practiced observer. It is also very
    much like <i>Selandria barda</i>, <i>Vitis</i>, and <i>pygmæa</i>, but has
    not the red thorax of these three closely allied species.
    It is of a deep and shining black color. The first two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> pairs of legs are brownish-gray or dirty white, except the
    thighs, which are almost entirely black. The hind legs are
    black, with whitish knees. The wings are smoky, and
    transparent, with dark brown veins, and a brown spot near
    the middle of the edge of the first pair. The body of the
    male is a little more than three-twentieths of an inch long,
    that of the female one-fifth of an inch or more, and the
    wings expand nearly or quite two-fifths of an inch. These
    saw-flies come out of the ground at various times between
    the twentieth of May and the middle of June, during
    which period they pair and lay their eggs. The females
    do not fly much, and may be seen, during most of the day,
    resting on the leaves; and, when touched, they draw up
    their legs, and fall to the ground. The males are more
    active, fly from one rose-bush to another, and hover around
    their sluggish partners. The latter, when about to lay
    their eggs, turn a little on one side, unsheathe their saws,
    and thrust them obliquely into the skin of the leaf, depositing
    in each incision thus made, a single egg. The
    young begin to hatch in ten days or a fortnight after the
    eggs are laid. They may sometimes be found on the
    leaves as early as the first of June, but do not usually appear
    in considerable numbers until the twentieth of the
    same month. How long they are in coming to maturity,
    I have not particularly observed; but the period of their
    existence in the caterpillar state probably does not exceed
    three weeks. They somewhat resemble the young of the
    saw-fly in form, but are not quite so convex. They have
    a small, round, yellowish head, with a black dot on each
    side of it, and are provided with twenty-two short legs.
    The body is green above, paler at the sides, and yellowish
    beneath; and it is soft, and almost transparent like jelly.
    The skin of the back is transversely wrinkled, and covered
    with minute elevated points; and there are two small,
    triple-pointed warts on the edge of the first ring, immediately
    behind the head. These gelatinous and sluggish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> creatures eat the upper surface of the leaf in large irregular
    patches, leaving the veins and the skin beneath untouched;
    and they are sometimes so thick that not a leaf
    on the bushes is spared by them, and the whole foliage
    looks as if it had been scorched by fire, and drops off soon
    afterward. They cast their skins several times, leaving
    them extended and fastened on the leaves; after the last
    moulting they lose their semi-transparent and greenish
    color, and acquire an opaque yellowish hue. They then
    leave the rose-bushes, some of them slowly creeping down
    the stem, and others rolling up and dropping off, especially
    when the bushes are shaken by the wind. Having
    reached the ground, they burrow to the depth of an inch
    or more in the earth, where each one makes for itself a
    small oval cell, of grains of earth, cemented with a little
    gummy silk. Having finished their transformations, and
    turned to flies, within their cells, they come out of the
    ground early in August, and lay their eggs for a second
    brood of young. These, in turn, perform their appointed
    work of destruction in the autumn; they then go into the
    ground, make their earthy cells, remain therein throughout
    the winter, and appear in the winged form, in the following
    spring and summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During several years past, these pernicious vermin
    have infested the rose-bushes in the vicinity of Boston,
    and have proved so injurious to them, as to have excited
    the attention of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society,
    by whom a premium of one hundred dollars for the most
    successful mode of destroying these insects was offered in
    the summer of 1840. About ten years ago, I observed
    them in gardens in Cambridge, and then made myself acquainted
    with their transformations. At that time they
    had not reached Milton, my former place of residence,
    and have appeared in that place only within two or three
    years. They now seem to be gradually extending in all
    directions, and an effectual method for preserving our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> roses from their attacks has become very desirable to all
    persons who set any value on this beautiful ornament of
    our gardens and shrubberies. Showering or syringing
    the bushes with a liquor, made by mixing with water the
    juice expressed from tobacco by tobacconists, has been
    recommended; but some caution is necessary in making
    this mixture of a proper strength, for if too strong, it is
    injurious to plants; and the experiment does not seem, as
    yet, to have been conducted with sufficient care to insure
    safety and success. Dusting lime over the plants when
    wet with dew has been tried, and found of some use; but
    this and all other remedies will probably yield in efficacy
    to Mr. Haggerston&rsquo;s mixture of whale-oil soap and water,
    in the proportion of two pounds of the soap to fifteen
    gallons of water. Particular directions, drawn up by
    Mr. Haggerston himself, for the preparation and use of
    this simple and cheap application, may be found in the
    &ldquo;Boston Courier&rdquo; for the 25th of June, 1841, and also
    in most of our agricultural and horticultural journals of
    the same time. The utility of this mixture has already
    been repeatedly mentioned in this treatise, and it may be
    applied in other eases with advantage. Mr. Haggerston
    finds that it effectually destroys many kinds of insects;
    and he particularly mentions plant-lice of various kinds,
    red spiders, canker-worms, and a little jumping insect
    which has lately been found quite as hurtful to rose-bushes
    as the slugs or young of the saw-fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Rose-Bug.</b>&mdash;<i>Macrodactylus subspinosa.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Common as
    this insect is in the vicinity of Boston, it is, or was a few
    years ago, unknown in the northern and western parts of
    Massachusetts, in New Hampshire, and in Maine. It
    may, therefore, be well to give a brief description of it.
    This beetle measures seven-twentieths of an inch in length.
    Its body is slender, tapers before and behind, and is entirely
    covered with very short and close ashen-yellow
    down; the thorax is long and narrow, angularly widened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> in the middle of each side, which suggested the name <i>subspinosa</i>, or somewhat spined; the legs are slender,
    and of a pale red color; the joints of the feet are tipped
    with black, and are very long, which caused Latreille to
    call the genus <i>Macrodactylus</i>, that is, long toe, or long
    foot. The natural history of the rose-chafer, one of the
    greatest scourges with which our gardens and nurseries
    have been afflicted, was for a long time involved in mystery,
    but is at last fully cleared up. The prevalence of
    this insect on the rose, and its annual appearance, coinciding
    with the blossoming of that flower, have gained for it
    the popular name by which it is here known. For some
    time after they were first noticed, rose-bugs appeared to
    be confined to their favorite, the blossoms of the rose;
    but within thirty years, they have prodigiously increased
    in number, have attacked at random various kinds of
    plants in swarms, and have become notorious for their extensive
    and deplorable ravages. The grape-vine in particular,
    the cherry, plum, and apple-trees, have annually
    suffered by their depredations; many other fruit-trees and
    shrubs, garden vegetables and corn, and even the trees of
    the forest, and the grass of the fields, have been laid under
    contribution by these indiscriminate feeders, by whom
    leaves, flowers, and fruits are alike consumed. The unexpected
    arrival of these insects in swarms, at their first
    coming, and their sudden disappearance at the close of
    their career, are remarkable facts in their history. They
    come forth from the ground during the second week in
    June, or about the time of the blossoming of the Damask
    Rose, and remain from thirty to forty days. At the end
    of this period the males become exhausted, fall to the
    ground, and perish, while the females enter the earth, lay
    their eggs, return to the surface, and, after lingering a few
    days, die also. The eggs laid by each female are about
    thirty in number, and are deposited from one to four
    inches beneath the surface of the soil; they are nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> globular, whitish, and about one-thirtieth of an inch in
    diameter, and are hatched twenty days after they are
    laid. The young larvæ begin to feed on such tender
    roots as are within their reach. Like other grubs of the
    Scarabæus, when not eating, they lie upon the side,
    with the body curved, so that the head and tail are nearly
    in contact; they move with difficulty on a level surface,
    and are continually falling over on one side or the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They attain their full size in autumn, being then nearly
    three-quarters of an inch long, and about an eighth of an
    inch in diameter. They are of a yellowish white color,
    with a tinge of blue towards the hinder extremity, which
    is thick and obtuse, or rounded; a few short hairs are
    scattered on the surface of the body; there are six short
    legs, namely, a pair to each of the first three rings behind
    the head, and the latter is covered with a horny shell of
    a pale rust color. In October they descend below the
    reach of frost, and pass the winter in a torpid state. In
    the spring they approach toward the surface, and each
    one forms for itself a little cell, of an oval shape, by turning
    round a great many times, so as to compress the
    earth, and render the inside of the cavity hard and
    smooth. Within this cell the grub is transformed to a
    pupa, during the month of May, by casting off its skin,
    which is pushed downward in folds from the head to the
    tail. The pupa has somewhat the form of the perfected
    beetle, but it is of a yellowish white color, and its short,
    stump-like wings, its antennæ, and its legs, are folded upon
    the breast, and its whole body is inclosed in a thin film
    that wraps each part separately. During the month of
    June this filmy skin is rent, the included beetle withdraws
    from its body and its limbs, bursts open its earthen
    cell, and digs its way to the surface of the ground. Thus
    the various changes from the egg to the full development
    of the perfected beetle are completed within the space of
    one year.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Such being the metamorphoses and habits of these
    insects, it is evident that we cannot attack them in the
    egg, the grub, or the pupa state; the enemy, in these
    stages, is beyond our reach, and is subject to the control
    only of the natural but unknown means appointed by the
    Author of Nature to keep the insect tribes in check.
    When they have issued from their subterranean retreats,
    and have congregated upon our vines, trees, and other
    vegetable productions in the complete enjoyment of their
    propensities, we must unite our efforts to seize and crush
    the invaders. They must indeed be crushed, scalded, or
    burned, to deprive them of life, for they are not affected
    by any of the applications usually found destructive to
    other insects. Experience has proved the utility of gathering
    them by hand, or of shaking them, or brushing
    them from the plants into tin vessels containing a little
    water. They should be collected daily during the period
    of their visitation, and should be committed to the flames,
    or killed by scalding water. The late John Lowell, Esq.,
    states, that in 1823, he discovered on a solitary apple-tree
    the rose-bugs &lsquo;in vast numbers, such as could not be
    described, and would not be believed if they were described,
    or at least none but an ocular witness could conceive
    of their numbers. Destruction by hand was out of
    the question&rsquo; in this case. He put sheets under the tree,
    and shook them down and burned them. Dr. Green, of
    Mansfield, whose investigations have thrown much light
    on the history of this insect, proposes protecting plants
    with millinet, and says that in this way only did he succeed
    in securing his grape-vines from depredation. His
    remarks also show the utility of gathering them. &lsquo;Eighty-six
    of these spoilers,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;were known to infest a
    single rose-bud, and were crushed with one grasp of the
    hand.&rsquo; Suppose, as was probably the case, that one-half
    of them were females; by this destruction, eight hundred
    eggs, at least, were prevented from becoming matured.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> During the time of their prevalence, rose-bugs are sometimes
    found in immense numbers on the flowers of the
    common white-weed, or ox-eye daisy, (<i>Chrysanthemum
    leucanthemum</i>,) a worthless plant, which has come to us
    from Europe, and has been suffered to overrun our pastures,
    and encroach on our mowing lands. In certain
    cases it may become expedient rapidly to mow down the
    infested white-weed in dry pastures, and consume it with
    the sluggish rose-bugs on the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our insect-eating birds undoubtedly devour many of
    these insects, and deserve to be cherished and protected
    for their services. Rose-bugs are also eaten greedily by
    domesticated fowls; and when they become exhausted
    and fall to the ground, or when they are about to lay
    their eggs, they are destroyed by moles, insects, and other
    animals, which lie in wait to seize them. Dr. Green informs
    us that a species of dragon-fly, or devil&rsquo;s needle,
    devours them. He also says that an insect, which he calls
    the enemy of the cut-worm, probably the larva of a
    Carabus, or predaceous ground-beetle, preys on the grubs
    of the common dor-bug. In France, the golden ground-beetle
    (<i>Carabus auratus</i>) devours the female dor or chafer
    at the moment when she is about to deposit her eggs. I
    have taken one specimen of this fine ground-beetle in
    Massachusetts, and we have several other kinds equally
    predaceous, which probably contribute to check the increase
    of our native Melolonthians.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Harris.</i></p>
<p>A. J. Downing recommends the use of open-mouthed
    bottles, half filled (and occasionally renewed) with a mixture
    of sweetened water and vinegar, and placed about
    the plant. He also recommends pouring boiling water on
    the ground, under the bushes, at the first appearance of
    the insects, and before their wings are formed. They
    nearly all rise to the surface of the ground, and emerge
    about the same time that the Damask Rose first begins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> to open. A little observation will enable the cultivator
    to seize the right time for the scalding operation.</p>
<p><b>Rose Leaf-Hopper.</b>&mdash;<i>Tettigonia Rosæ</i> of Harris, who
    states that it has been mistaken for the Vine-fretter,
    or Thrips. It is yellowish white, and about three-twentieths
    of an inch long; the male has two recurved appendages
    at the tip of its hind body. Dr. Harris says, &ldquo;Swarms
    of these insects may be found in various stages of growth
    on the leaves of the rose-bush through the greater part of
    summer, and even in winter upon housed plants. Their
    numerous cast skins may be seen adhering to the lower
    side of the leaves. They pair and lay their eggs about
    the middle of June, and they probably live through the
    winter in the perfect state, concealed under fallen leaves
    and rubbish on the surface of the ground. Fumigation
    with tobacco, and the application of a solution of whale-oil
    soap in water with a syringe, is the best means for
    destroying these leaf-hoppers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have enumerated but a very small part of the numerous
    insects which infest the rose, and in the absence
    of correct information on this important branch of floriculture,
    it is much to be hoped that farther investigations
    will be made by men of leisure. As an instance of the great
    variety of these insects, a French writer remarks that he
    &ldquo;found in less than an hour, on the leaves of two species only
    of the Rose, six kinds of small caterpillars, all differing from
    each other in the number of their feet, the color of their
    head and body, and the lines and points with which they
    were marked. Their habits were all apparently the same.
    They lived between two or three folds which they had secured
    in shape by the films of their silk. Thus enveloped
    and protected, they eat the leaf until it is wholly or at
    least partly consumed. They then endeavor to establish
    themselves on another leaf, in which also they enwrap
    themselves, and consume it in the same manner. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> plants attacked by these caterpillars are known by their
    ruffled leaves, partly eaten, and more or less covered with
    silk.&rdquo; The writer does not give their name, nor the result
    of any experiments for their destruction; he merely
    mentions it as an instance of the great abundance of insects
    on almost every plant. Such being the case, there
    is abundant room for farther observation and research.</p>

<h3>THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE ROSE, AND FABLES
    RESPECTING ITS ORIGIN.</h3>
<p>Very little is known of the early history of the Rose,
    or who were its first cultivators; and on this point all is
    conjecture. Mention of it is made in the ancient Coptic
    manuscripts, while nothing concerning it can be distinguished,
    with any degree of certainty, on the Egyptian
    monuments which are left us. Bocastre, the French traveler,
    observes that he carefully searched all the monuments
    in Egypt, and could find neither sculpture nor painting,
    figure nor hieroglyphic, that would lead us to suppose that
    the Rose was cultivated by the ancient Egyptians. We
    are, however, induced to believe that this beautiful flower
    was known to them, from the fact that several varieties
    are now found in Egypt. Dr. Delile, Director of the Botanic
    Garden at Montpelier, and with whom we enjoyed
    some pleasant intercourse during a visit to that place,
    was with Napoleon in his expedition to Egypt. In his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> valuable published account of that expedition, he mentions
    that he found there two Roses&mdash;<i>Rosa alba</i>, and <i>Rosa centifolia</i>; and there is also reason to believe, that
    under Domitian the Egyptians cultivated another&mdash;<i>Rosa
    bifera</i>. It is quite probable that the Rose was planted in
    the celebrated gardens of Babylon, the formation of which
    is attributed to Semiramis, about 1200 years before the
    Christian era; and it also appears probable, from the testimony
    of modern travelers, that several kinds of roses
    crossed over into Persia.</p>
<p>It is very certain that the Rose was cultivated by the
    Jews during the reign of Solomon, about two centuries
    after Semiramis; for mention of this flower is made in the
    Scripture books attributed to that king. In the Song of
    Solomon, he says: &ldquo;I am the Rose of Sharon, and the
    Lily of the valleys;&rdquo; and in the Apocryphal Wisdom of
    Solomon&mdash;&ldquo;Let us crown ourselves with rose-buds before
    they be withered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It also appears, by several passages of the Book of
    Ecclesiasticus, the author of which lived about 700 years
    after Solomon, that the Jews possessed beautiful gardens
    of roses, particularly at Jericho. &ldquo;I was exalted like a
    palm-tree in Engaddi, and as a rose-plant in Jericho:&rdquo;
    xxiv. 14. &ldquo;Hearken unto me, ye holy children, and bud
    forth as a rose growing by the brook of the field:&rdquo; xxxix.
    13. &ldquo;And as the flower of roses in the spring of the
    year:&rdquo; l. 8. These passages prove that this most fertile
    and beautiful portion of Palestine abounded in roses,
    palms, and cedars. They no longer however, abound;
    for while &ldquo;the cedars wave on Lebanon,&rdquo; and the solitary
    palm stands in its isolated beauty, the Rose has entirely
    disappeared; and that now called the Rose of Jericho is
    but a little plant of the family of <i>Cruciferæ</i>. The Greeks
    cultivated the Rose at an early period, during the time
    of Homer, who lived about 200 years after the wise Hebrew
    monarch. In the Iliad and Odyssey he borrows the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> brilliant colors of the Rose to paint the rising of the sun.
    Aurora, according to this poet, has fingers of roses, and
    perfumes the air with roses. Few poets are more celebrated
    than Homer for beauty of conception, and for his
    frequent similes borrowed from natural objects. His selection,
    in this instance, evinces that the Rose was neither
    an unknown nor an unadmired flower. Herodotus, who
    lived about 400 years before the Christian era, mentions
    that in Macedonia, in the gardens which were supposed
    to have belonged to Midas, there were roses of sixty petals,
    which grew spontaneously without culture, and
    emitted a most delightful perfume.</p>
<p>Ancient writings are full of allusions to the Rose, and
    fabulous accounts of its origin. From its brilliant colors,
    melting into each other as the shades of night melt into
    the glowing richness of the rising sun, it was frequently
    consecrated to Aurora. It was also consecrated to Harpocrates,
    the patron of Silence, of which it was considered
    the symbol. Thus the expression, &ldquo;<i>sub rosa</i>&rdquo; (under
    the Rose), signified that all that was said should remain
    secret; and there is scarcely used a more expressive device
    for a seal than the simple figure of a Rose. It was
    the custom, in some of the northern countries, to suspend
    a Rose over the table in the dining-room, reminding the
    guests that silence should be observed respecting all that
    might be said during the meal.</p>
<p>Anacreon, Bion, Theocritus, Apollodorus, and others,
    relate various fables respecting its origin, and its obtaining
    the bright color for which it is distinguished.</p>
<p>One fable relates that Flora, having found the dead
    body of one of her favorite nymphs, whose beauty could
    only be equaled by her virtue, implored the assistance of
    all the Olympian deities to aid her in changing it into a
    flower, which all others should acknowledge to be their
    queen. Apollo lent the vivifying power of his beams,
    Bacchus bathed it in nectar, Vertumnus gave its perfume,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> Pomona its fruit, and Flora herself gave its diadem of
    flowers. A beetle is often represented on antique gems
    as expiring, surrounded by roses; and this is supposed to
    be an emblem of luxurious enervation; the beetle being
    said to have such an antipathy to roses, that the smell of
    them will cause its death.</p>
<p>From the earliest period the Greeks gave to the Rose
    the preference over all other plants, and distinguished it
    as the &ldquo;Queen of Flowers.&rdquo; In the fragments which still
    exist of Sappho, who lived about 600 years before the
    Christian era, there are lines in which the Rose is placed
    in the highest rank.</p>
<p>Since Sappho, many poets, both ancient and modern,
    have celebrated in their songs the charming qualities
    of the Rose. They have chosen it for an emblem
    of the most beautiful things&mdash;for the most pleasing and
    delightful comparisons; and they have united in making
    it the symbol of innocence, of modesty, of grace, and of
    beauty. Quite a volume might be collected of all the
    verses and pleasant sentences that have been inspired by
    the elegant form of the Rose, its charming color, and delightful
    fragrance. Some of these we have inserted in
    another part of the work. Nothing proves better the
    preference which has always existed for this beautiful
    flower than the thoughts expressed by Sappho. Anacreon
    and the other poets of antiquity have since imitated her
    in almost every language, and the lines of these have sacrificed
    nothing of her elegance and freshness.</p>
<p>The poets and writers of the East have abundantly
    celebrated in their works the beauties of the Rose. According
    to the Boun-Dehesch, of Zoroaster, the stem of
    that flower was free from thorns until the entrance of
    Ahrimanus (the evil one) into the world; the universal
    spirit of evil, according to their doctrine, affecting not
    only man, but also the inferior animals, and even the very
    trees and plants. The same work states that every flower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> is appropriated to a particular angel, and that the hundred-leaved
    Rose (<i>Rosa centifolia</i>) is consecrated to an
    archangel of the highest order. Basil, one of the early
    fathers, had undoubtedly seen these passages in oriental
    works, when he related that at the creation of the world
    the Rose had no thorns, and that it was gradually furnished
    with them as mankind became more corrupt.</p>
<p>The oriental writers also represent the nightingale as
    sighing for the love of the Rose; and many beautiful
    stanzas have arisen from this fable. According to the <i>Language of Flowers</i>; &ldquo;In a curious fragment by the celebrated
    Persian poet, Attar, entitled <i>Bulbul Nameh</i>, the
    Book of the Nightingale, all the birds appear before Solomon,
    and charge the nightingale with disturbing their rest
    by the broken and plaintive strains which he warbles forth
    all the night in a sort of frenzy and intoxication. The
    nightingale is summoned, questioned, and acquitted by
    the wise king; because the bird assures him that his vehement
    love for the Rose drives him to distraction, and
    causes him to break forth into those passionate and touching
    complaints which are laid to his charge.&rdquo; The same
    work also mentions that the Persians assert that &ldquo;the
    nightingale, in spring, flutters around the rose-bushes, uttering
    incessant complaints, till, overpowered by the
    strong scent, he drops stupefied on the ground.&rdquo; The invention
    of these fables, extravagant as they are, evince
    the Persian fondness for this beautiful flower. The Ghebers,
    or Persian fire-worshipers, believe that Abraham was
    thrown into the fire by Nimrod, when the flame turned
    into a bed of roses. According to the Hindoo mythology,
    Pagoda Siri, one of the wives of Vishnu, was found
    in a rose.</p>
<p>Among the many stories of roses in the East, is that
    of the philosopher Zeb, related by Madame de Latour.
    &ldquo;There was at Amadan, in Persia, an academy with the
    following rules: Its members must think much, write a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> little, and be as silent as possible. The learned Zeb, celebrated
    through all the East, learning that there was a
    vacancy in the academy, endeavored to obtain it, but arrived,
    unfortunately, too late. The academy was annoyed
    because it had given to power what belonged to merit;
    and the president, not knowing how to express a refusal
    without mortifying the assembly, caused a cup to be
    brought, which he filled so full of water, that a single
    drop more would have made it run over. The wise philosopher
    understood by that emblem that no place remained
    for him, and was retiring sadly, when he perceived
    a rose petal at his feet. At that sight he took
    courage, seized the petal, and placed it so delicately on
    the water, that not a single drop escaped. At this ingenious
    allusion to the rules of the academy, the whole
    assembly clapped their hands, and the philosopher was
    admitted as a member.&rdquo; Madame de Genlis relates very
    nearly the same anecdote, but attributes it to Abdul-kadri,
    a person celebrated among the Turks, who was desirous
    of residing at Babylon, where they were unwilling to receive
    him.</p>
<p>The Turks themselves, matter-of-fact as they are, have
    also seen something marvelous in the beautiful and vivid
    tints which the hand of nature has painted on the corolla
    of the Rose; but their imagination, less glowing than
    that of the Greeks, furnished them an idea more singular
    than pleasing. They suppose that the Rose owed its
    origin to the perspiration which fell from Mahomet; for
    which reason they never tread upon a rose-leaf, or suffer
    one to lie on the ground.</p>
<p>Meshilu, the Turkish poet, speaks of &ldquo;a pavilion of
    roses as the seat of pleasure raised in the garden;&rdquo; of
    &ldquo;roses like the bright cheeks of beautiful maidens;&rdquo; of
    the time when &ldquo;the plants were sick, and the rose-bud
    hung its thoughtful head on its bosom;&rdquo; and of the &ldquo;dew,
    as it falls, being changed into rose-water.&rdquo; They also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> sculpture a rose on the tombstone of a female who dies
    unmarried.</p>
<p>The early Roman Catholics have made the Rose the
    subject of various miraculous events, one of which is
    attributed to the canonized Elizabeth, Queen of Hungary.
    As the French author, Montalembert, relates it in his history
    of that Queen, Elizabeth loved to carry to the poor
    herself, by stealth, not only money, but even food, and
    other things which she had provided for them. She went
    thus loaded, and on foot, by the steep and hidden paths
    which led from the chateau to the town, and to the cottages
    in the neighboring valleys. One day, when, accompanied
    by her favorite maid, she was descending by a
    rough and scarcely visible path, carrying under her cloak
    some bread, meat, eggs, and other food, for distribution
    among the poor, she was suddenly met by her husband,
    who was returning from the chase. Astonished to see
    her thus bending under the weight of her burden, he said
    to her, &ldquo;Let me see what you are carrying.&rdquo; At the
    same time he threw open the cloak, which she held, with
    terror, to her breast, but found, as the legend says, nothing
    there but some white and red roses, the most beautiful
    he had ever seen.</p>
<p>D&rsquo;Orbessan, in his work on the Rose, states, that in the
    church of Sainte-Luzanne, at Rome, is a mosaic of the
    time of Charlemagne, in which that prince is represented
    in a square mantle, and on his knees, while St. Peter is
    placing in his hands a standard covered with roses.</p>
<p>Michaud, in his <i>Biographie Universelle</i>, speaks of
    Clemence Isaure, a French lady, who lived in the latter
    part of the fifteenth century. She bequeathed to the
    academy of Toulouse a large income, exclusively for the
    celebration of floral games, and for the distribution of
    five prizes for as many pieces of poetry. The prizes consisted
    of an amaranth and rose of gold, and of a violet,
    marigold, and lily, of silver. The will also required that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> every three years, on the day of the commencement of
    the floral games, among other ceremonies to be observed,
    the members of the academy should visit and spread
    flowers upon her tomb. Ronsard, the French poet, having
    gained the first prize in the floral games, received, in
    place of the accustomed rose, a silver image of Minerva.
    Mary, Queen of Scots, was so much delighted with Ronsard&rsquo;s
    beautiful poetry on the Rose, that she sent him a
    magnificent rose of silver, valued at £500, with this inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>A.
    Ronsard. l&rsquo;Apollon de la source des
    Muses.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<h3>LUXURIOUS USE OF THE ROSE.</h3>
<p>The ancients possessed, at a very early period, the luxury
    of roses, and the Romans brought it to perfection by
    covering with beds of these flowers the couches whereon
    their guests were placed, and even the tables which were
    used for banquets;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> while some emperors went so far as
    to scatter them in the halls of their palaces. At Rome,
    they were, at one time, brought from Egypt in that part
    of the year when Italy could not produce them; but afterwards,
    in order to render these luxuries more easily attainable
    during the winter by the leaders of the <i>ton</i> in
    that capital city of the world&rsquo;s empire, their gardeners
    found the means of producing, in green-houses warmed
    by means of pipes filled with hot water, an artificial temperature,
    which kept roses and lilies in bloom until the
    last of the year. Seneca declaimed, with a show of ridicule,
    against these improvements;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> but, without being
    discouraged by the reasoning of the philosopher, the Romans
    carried their green-houses to such perfection that,
    at length, during the reign of Domitian, when the Egyptians
    thought to pay him a splendid compliment in honor
    of his birthday, by sending him roses in the midst of
    winter, their present excited nothing but ridicule and
    disdain, so abundant had winter roses become at Rome
    by the efforts of art. Few of the Latin poets have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> more celebrated for their epigrammatic wit than Martial;
    and his epigram &ldquo;To Cæsar, on the Winter Roses,&rdquo; serves
    to show that the culture of roses at Rome was carried to
    such perfection as to make the attempts of foreign competitors
    subjects only for ridicule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ambitious inhabitants of the land watered by the
    Nile have sent thee, O Cæsar, the roses of winter, as a
    present valuable for its novelty. But the boatman of
    Memphis will laugh at the gardens of Pharaoh as soon as
    he has taken one step in thy capital city&mdash;for the spring,
    in its charms, and the flowers in their fragrance and
    beauty, equal the glory of the fields of Pæstum. Wherever
    he wanders or casts his eyes, every street is brilliant
    with garlands of roses. And thou, O Nile, must now
    yield to the fogs of Rome. Send us thy harvests, and we
    will send thee roses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this passage it is evident that the cultivation of
    Roses among the ancients was much farther advanced
    than is generally supposed. In another epigram Martial
    speaks again of roses, which were formerly seen only in
    the spring, but which, in his time, had become common
    during the winter. We are, also, but copyists of the Romans
    in the cultivation of flowers in windows; for vases
    of every style of beauty, and filled with roses, were a frequent
    ornament of their windows. Martial says that a
    miserly patron had made him a present of a very small
    estate, and adds that he has a much better country place
    in his window. Much that illustrates the use which the
    ancients made of roses in their ceremonies, in their festivals,
    and in their domestic life, may be found in various
    authors, evincing still more how very common the use of
    them had become. Florus relates that Antiochus, king
    of Syria, being encamped in the island of Eub&#339;a, under
    woven tents of silk and gold, was not only accompanied
    by a band of musicians, but that he might yet more enhance
    his pleasures, he wished to procure roses; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> although it was in the midst of winter, he caused them to
    be collected from every quarter.</p>
<p>The gallants of Rome were in the habit of presenting
    their favorite damsels with the first roses that appeared
    in spring; and &ldquo;<i>Mea rosa</i>&rdquo; was an affectionate expression
    they often used to their betrothed.</p>
<p>We frequently find in old Latin authors an entire abandonment
    to pleasure and excessive luxury, signified by
    such expressions as &ldquo;living in the midst of roses,&rdquo; &ldquo;sleeping
    on roses,&rdquo; etc. (&ldquo;<i>Vivere in rosa</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>dormire in rosa</i>.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Seneca speaks of Smyndiride, the most wealthy and
    voluptuous of the Sybarites, who could not sleep if a single
    one of the rose-petals with which his bed was spread,
    happened to be curled.</p>
<p>Cicero, in his &ldquo;<i>De finibus</i>,&rdquo; alludes to the custom which
    prevailed at Rome at that time, of reclining at the table
    on couches covered with roses; and comparing the happiness
    which virtue gives to the pleasures of luxury says,
    that &ldquo;Regulus, in his chains, was more happy than Thorius
    drinking on a couch of roses, and living in such a manner
    that one could scarcely imagine any rare and exquisite
    pleasure of which he did not partake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same author, in his celebrated speech against
    Verres, the greatest extortioner whose name is recorded
    in history, reproached him not only with the outrageous
    robberies and cruelties which he committed during the
    three years that he was governor of Sicily, but yet more
    with his effeminacy and licentiousness. &ldquo;When spring
    commenced,&rdquo; said the Roman orator, &ldquo;that season was
    not announced to him by the return of Zephyr, nor by the
    appearance of any heavenly sign; it was not until he had
    seen the roses bloom that spring was visible to his voluptuous
    eye. In the voyages which he made across the
    province, he was accustomed, after the example of the
    kings of Bithynia, to be carried in a litter borne by eight
    men, in which he reposed, softly extended upon cushions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> made of transparent material, and filled with roses of
    Malta, having in his hand a net of the finest linen, and
    equally full of these flowers, whose fragrance incessantly
    gratified his eager nostrils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Latinus Pacatus, in his eulogium on the Emperor Theodosius,
    inveighs against the luxury of the Romans, whose
    sensual desires, he says, were not satisfied until they had
    reversed the order of the seasons, and produced roses in
    the winter season to crown their cup of wine, and until
    their Falernian, during the summer, was cooled in large
    vessels filled with ice. The forcing of roses in winter is
    no longer extensively practiced in Rome; but during the
    summer they are abundant, and we recollect being much
    struck with admiration of some beautiful hedges of the
    Daily rose in the villas near Rome.</p>
<p>After reading the preceding statements of the abundance
    of roses among the ancient Romans, it is with some
    surprise that we recollect the great scarcity of that flower
    during the gayest and most animated festival of the modern
    Romans&mdash;the Carnival. As we slowly walked along
    the Corso, submitting with as quiet a grace as possible to
    the various fantastic tricks of the masked figures around
    us, and occasionally pelted with handfuls of sugar-plums
    from the windows, or passing carriages, we looked in vain
    for roses or camellias in the numerous bouquets that were
    cleaving the air around us. Little bouquets of violets
    were numerous, and the air was thick with them, as our
    eyes, nose, and mouth, could bear striking witness; and
    we recollect, too, the contemptuous curl of the lip, and
    rush of the aristocratic blood into the face of a fair English
    girl in one of the carriages whose blue eyes had been
    nearly closed by an awkward cast of one of these little
    bouquets from the hand of a plebian performer. But we
    only recollect catching a glimpse now and then of a <i>single</i> rose or camellia, skillfully passed by a cavalier below into
    the hands of some dark-eyed beauty in the balconies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> above, the bright sparkle of whose eye convinced us that
    the single flower was of value, and a mark of especial regard.
    The Rose appeared to be valued as some rare
    exotic, and not to be idly bestowed where there was small
    probability of its due appreciation; it was, indeed, a
    &ldquo;<i>rara flora in urbe</i>,&rdquo; and quite superseded by the very
    pretty and abundant violets.</p>
<p>The modern Romans have not only lost many of the
    good qualities of their early ancestors, but they have also
    escaped much of the effeminate softness which characterized
    the Romans under some of the later emperors; and,
    as belonging to this state of luxury, the cultivation of the
    Rose has, in modern times, been much neglected. The
    homage of the Romans is now reserved for art, and the
    beautiful products of nature are, in their opinion, worthy
    only of secondary consideration. The Rose is now mostly
    confined in that city to the residences of the wealthier
    classes, and can scarcely be said to have resumed its old
    place in Roman esteem until it is again a favorite with
    the mass of the people.</p>
<p>When Cleopatra went into Cilicia to meet Mark Antony,
    she gave him, for several successive days, festivals
    in which she displayed a truly royal magnificence. She
    caused to be placed in the banqueting hall twelve couches,
    each of which would hold three guests. The walls were
    covered with purple tapestry, interwoven with gold; all
    the vases were of gold, admirably executed, and enriched
    with precious stones.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, the queen carried her sumptuousness
    so far as to pay a talent (about six hundred dollars)
    for a quantity of roses, with which she caused the floor
    of the hall to be covered to the depth of eighteen inches.
    These flowers were retained by a very fine net, in order
    that the guests might walk over them.</p>
<p>After the loss of the battle of Actium, Antony, not
    wishing to survive his defeat, from fear of falling into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> the hands of Augustus, thrust himself through with his
    sword, and requested Cleopatra to scatter perfumes over
    his tomb, and to cover it with roses.</p>
<p>The greatest profusion of roses mentioned in ancient
    history, and which is scarcely credible, is that which Suetonius
    attributes to Nero. This author says, that at a
    fête which the emperor gave in the Gulf of Baiæ, when
    inns were established on the banks, and ladies of distinction
    played the part of hostesses, the expense incurred for
    roses alone was more than four millions of sesterces&mdash;about
    $100,000. Since Nero, many of his successors have
    nearly equaled him in prodigal enjoyment of the luxury
    of roses. Lucius Aurelius Verus, whose licentiousness
    and destitution of every manly quality equaled that of
    the worst emperors, but whom no one reproaches with
    any act of cruelty, was the inventor of a new species of
    luxury. He had a couch made on which were four raised
    cushions, closed on all sides by a very thin net, and filled
    with leaves of roses. Heliogabalus, celebrated for luxury
    and vice of every kind, caused roses to be crushed with
    the kernels of the pine (Pinus maritima), in order to increase
    the perfume. The same emperor caused roses to
    be scattered over the couches, the halls, and even the
    porticoes of the palace, and he renewed this profusion
    with flowers of every kind&mdash;lilies, violets, hyacinths, narcissus,
    etc. Gallien, another equally cruel and luxurious
    prince, lay, according to some authors, under arbors of
    roses; and, according to others, on beds covered with
    these flowers. And finally, Carrius, another licentious
    and prodigal emperor, who reigned only a few months
    caused roses to be scattered over the chambers of his
    palace, and on the couches of his guests.</p>

<h3>THE ROSE, IN CEREMONIES AND FESTIVALS, AND IN
    THE ADORNMENT OF BURIAL-PLACES.</h3>
<p>Among the ancients, the Rose was conspicuous in all
    the sacred ceremonies, and in public and private fêtes.
    The Greeks and the Romans surrounded the statues of
    Venus, of Hebe, and of Flora, with garlands of roses.
    They were lavish of these flowers at the festivals of Flora;
    in those of Juno, at Argos, the statue of the Olympian
    Queen was crowned with lilies and roses. In the festivals
    of Hymen, at Athens, the youth of both sexes, crowned
    with roses and adorned with flowers, mingled in dances
    which were intended to represent the innocence of primeval
    times. At Rome, in the public rejoicings, they sometimes
    strewed the streets with roses and other flowers.
    It is thus that Lucretius gives a description of the manner
    in which were celebrated the festivals of Cybele.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
<p>To scatter flowers on the passage of the funeral procession
    of a private citizen was an honor not common at
    Rome. Pliny informs us, however, that a Scipio, belonging
    to the illustrious family of that name, who while he
    was tribune, fulfilled his duties to the satisfaction of the
    people, dying without leaving sufficient to pay his funeral
    expenses, the people voluntarily contributed to pay them,
    and on the appearance of the body, cast flowers upon its
    passage.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>
<p>At Baiæ, when fêtes were given upon the water, the
    whole surface of the lake of Lucina appeared covered
    with roses.</p>
<p>The custom of encircling the head, of surrounding the
    neck, and also the breast, with crowns and garlands of
    roses, on different occasions, and particularly during the
    last days of a gay festival, when, after the solid dishes,
    they passed to the dessert and the rare wines, is well
    known by the odes of Anacreon, and from the writings
    of several of the ancient poets.</p>
<p>The voluptuous Horace, when he abandoned himself to
    pleasures, was always supplied with roses. In congratulating
    one of his friends on his safe return from Spain, he
    recommended that these flowers should not be wanting at
    the festival. On another occasion, he told his favorite
    servant that he cordially disliked the pompous displays of
    the Persians, and escaped them by searching in what
    place the late Rose was found. Drawing a picture of
    luxurious ease for his friend Hirpinus, he speaks of &ldquo;lying
    under the shade of a lofty Plane or Pine tree, perfuming
    our spotless hair with Assyrian spikenard, and crowning
    ourselves with roses.&rdquo; We can very well judge how
    general had become the custom of making crowns of
    roses, from the number of times which it is mentioned in
    Pliny, and the frequency with which Martial speaks of it
    in his epigrams. The latter author also informs us, that
    in the very height of Roman luxury and revealing, the
    most favorable time for soliciting and obtaining a favor
    was when the patron was entirely given up to the pleasures
    of the table and of roses.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
<p>Whatever doubt may exist of the use of crowns of
    roses, as objects of luxury, it is well authenticated, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> among medical men of antiquity, endeavors were made to
    determine what kinds of flowers were suitable to place in
    crowns without detriment to health; and according to
    the report made on this subject, the parsley, the ivy, the
    myrtle, and the Rose, possessed peculiar virtues for dissipating
    the fumes of the wine. According to Athenæus,
    a crown of roses possessed not only the property of alleviating
    pain in the head, but had a very refreshing effect.</p>
<p>Pliny mentions two Greek physicians&mdash;Mnesitheus and
    Callimachus,&mdash;who wrote on this subject.</p>
<p>The custom of crowning with roses had passed from
    the Greeks to the Romans, and it also existed among the
    Hebrews, who had probably borrowed it from some of the
    neighboring nations, either from the Egyptians, in the
    midst of whom they had spent many years, or from the
    Babylonians, with whom they had in the captivity much
    connection. The practice of this custom among the
    Israelites is attested by the previously quoted passage,
    in the apocryphal &ldquo;Wisdom of Solomon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Rome it was not only at the religious festivals that
    they crowned themselves with roses and other flowers,
    but it was the custom to wear these crowns during public
    and private fêtes; they were strictly forbidden at some
    other times, and above all on certain public occasions,
    where to appear with such an ornament would pass for an
    insult to a public calamity. Pliny informs us, that during
    the second Punic war, which lasted sixteen years, a banker
    named Lucius Fulvius, for looking from his gallery on the
    Forum, and wearing a crown of roses on his head, was,
    by order of the Senate, sent to prison, from which he was
    not liberated until the end of the war.</p>
<p>This anecdote, moreover, proves that crowns of roses
    were in fashion at Rome at an early period, and before
    licentiousness and luxury had yet made many inroads upon
    the national character.</p>
<p>It may readily be supposed, that at Rome, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> emperors, the use of crowns of flowers was, like every
    other species of luxury at that time, constantly on the increase.
    At first they wore the crowns interwoven with
    leaves of flowers, then they wore them composed partly
    of roses, and finally they were not satisfied unless they
    consisted of these flowers only.</p>
<p>Martial, as we have already mentioned, speaks often of
    his crowns of roses. The crown sent by this poet to his
    friend Sabinus was composed entirely of these flowers,
    and he was desirous that they should be considered the
    production of his own gardens.</p>
<p>From the poverty of Turkish history, little is known of
    the early use of the Rose among them. We have, however,
    some account of its use among the Mohammedan
    Persians.</p>
<p>Although wine was forbidden by the laws of Mahomet,
    the Persians frequently made use of it; and in the time
    of Tavernier and of Chardin, they frequently drank it to
    excess. One of their kings, Soliman III., was intoxicated
    almost every day; and it was the custom then in Persia,
    to serve the wine in crystal decanters, which, when the
    season permitted, they corked with roses.</p>
<p>The most interesting purpose to which roses were devoted
    was the adornment of tombs and burial-places.
    The Greeks employed generally for this object, the myrtle
    and the amaranth; but the Romans gave the preference
    to the lily, the saffron-plant, and, above all, the Rose.</p>
<p>The ancients were careful to renew the plants which
    were placed around the sepulchral urn, in order that it
    might be surrounded by a continual spring. These flowers
    were regarded as sacred, and as a relic of the deceased.</p>
<p>The Romans considered this pious care so agreeable to
    the spirits of the departed, that wealthy citizens bequeathed
    by will entire gardens, to be reserved for furnishing
    their tombs with flowers. They also often ordered that
    their heirs, or those to whom they left a legacy for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> care of their ashes, should meet together every year, on
    the anniversary of their death, and dine near their tomb,
    scattering roses about the place. This custom is attested
    by several stories of ancient Roman tombs. One with an
    ancient inscription was found at Ravenna, and others in
    some other parts of Italy.</p>
<p>D&rsquo;Orbessan, in his &ldquo;<i>Essai sur les Roses</i>,&rdquo; mentions having
    seen, at Torcello, a city about five miles from Venice,
    an inscription of this kind, mentioning a donation made
    by an emancipated slave to the assembly of the <i>Centum</i>,
    consisting of gardens and a building to be employed in
    celebrating his obsequies and those of his master. It requested
    that roses should not be spared, and that food
    should be then distributed in abundance. Generally, the
    donation made on condition of covering the funeral monument
    with roses was transferred to another, if that condition
    was not fulfilled. Sometimes the most terrible
    maledictions threatened those who dared to violate these
    sacred gardens. That which proves how frequent among
    the Romans was this custom of ornamenting tombs with
    roses is, that those who were not rich enough to make
    such bequests often directed to be engraved upon the
    stone which covered their remains a request to the passers-by
    to scatter roses upon their tomb. Some of these stones
    still exist, with the following inscription: &ldquo;<i>Sparge, precor,
    Rosas supra mea busta, viator.</i>&rdquo; It was, perhaps,
    because they compared the short duration of human life
    to the quick fading existence of the Rose, that this flower
    was devoted to the burial-place of the dead; and there
    can certainly be chosen no more beautiful emblem of this
    transitory state of existence. This supposition is somewhat
    strengthened by the following passage from Jerome,
    one of the early Christian fathers:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;The ancients scattered roses over the urns of the deceased, and in
        their wills ordered that these flowers should adorn their graves, and
        should be renewed every year. It was also the custom for husbands to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> cast roses, violets, and lilies, on the urns which enclosed the ashes of
        their wives. These modest flowers were emblematic signs of their
        grief. Our Christians were content to place a Rose among the ornaments
        of their graves, as the image of life.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Turkey, females that died unmarried had a rose
    sculptured at the top of their monument.</p>
<p>At the well-known cemetery of Père la Chaise, which
    has often excited the ecstasy, admiration, or praise of many
    travelers, but which in reality exhibits neither elegance,
    sentiment, nor taste, wreaths of roses and other flowers
    are frequently seen upon the thickly crowded tombs, either
    as mementos of affection, or in compliance with a popular
    custom; while the street leading to the cemetery is filled
    with shops in which are exposed for sale the wreaths of
    flowers.</p>
<p>The prevalence of the same custom in Denmark is alluded
    to by Shakespeare, in Hamlet, in the scene of
    Ophelia&rsquo;s burial.</p>
<p>The custom still remains also in America and Great
    Britain. In Wales, when a young girl dies, her female
    companions bring flowers with them to her funeral, and
    place them in her coffin. They plant lilies and snow-drops
    over the graves of children, and wild and cultivated roses
    over those of adults.</p>
<p>Gwillym, a Welsh poet, thus speaks of the custom in
    one of his elegies:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! while the season of flowers
    and the tender sprays, thick of leaves, remain, I will pluck
    the roses from the brakes, to be offered to the memory of
    a child of fairest fame; humbly will I lay them on the
    grave of Ivor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evelyn tells us that &ldquo;the white rose was planted at the
    grave of a virgin, and her chaplet was tied with white
    riband, in token of her spotless innocence; though sometimes
    black ribands were intermingled, to bespeak the
    grief of the survivors. The red rose was occasionally
    used in remembrance of such as had been remarkable for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> their benevolence; but roses in general were appropriated
    to the graves of lovers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drummond, the Scotch poet, requested one of his
    friends to have the following couplet placed over his grave:</p>
<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&ldquo;Here Damon lies, whose songs did sometimes grace<br />
        </span> <span class="i1">The murmuring Esk:&mdash;may roses shade the place.&rdquo;<br />
        </span> </div>
</div>
<p>The first Christians disapproved of the use of these
    flowers, either at their festivals or as ornaments for their
    tombs, on account of its connection with the pagan mythology,
    and the custom thus became extinct. Tertullian
    wrote a book against crowns and garlands. Clement of
    Alexandria thought it improper that Christians should
    crown themselves with roses. A little later, however,
    Christians relaxed from this strictness, and the Christian
    poet Prudence did not fear to invite his brethren &ldquo;to cover
    with violets and with verdure, and to surround with perfumes
    those bones which the voice of the All-Powerful
    would one day restore to life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Roman Catholics of this day admit flowers to their
    churches and ceremonies, and on feast days they adorn
    the altars with bouquets and garlands. At the most imposing
    of these solemnities, the day of the &ldquo;<i>Fête-Dieu</i>,&rdquo;
    rose petals, during the procession, are scattered in the air,
    and blended with the perfume of censers, directed towards
    the Host; in many of the towns, particularly those in the
    south of France and of Europe, the streets through which
    the procession passes are scattered throughout with fragrant
    herbs and flowers of every kind.</p>
<p>Since the extinction of paganism in a greater part of
    the world, the custom of wearing crowns of flowers at festivals
    has passed entirely away. Women only use roses
    as an ornament for their hair, or employ them in different
    parts of their toilet. In our own country the toilet of a
    bride is never considered perfect unless she wears a wreath
    of roses or other flowers, whose snow-white hue is an emblem
    of her departing maidenhood. Sometimes she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> provided only with a bouquet of white roses and camellias,
    and her bridesmaids wear similar ornaments of nature&rsquo;s
    manufacture.</p>
<p>The Rose is abundantly used by children in their beautiful
    celebration of May-day. We well recollect our enjoyment
    of one of these scenes some years since. We
    were returning from a ride in the vicinity of Charleston,
    S.C., on the first day of this, the sunniest of the months
    of spring&mdash;a day dedicated not to the spirit of motion,
    and celebrated not by processions of furniture carts, amid
    the bustle and noise of a populous city, but dedicated
    there, at the sunny South, to innocent and joyous festivity,
    and celebrated amid all the fresh and fragrant luxuriance
    of southern vegetation, surrounded by the delicate sweetness
    of the magnolia, the Rose, and other flowers, while
    the mocking-bird, with its sweet and varied note, was the
    minstrel for the occasion. Riding quietly along the road,
    we were suddenly stopped by a procession which had just
    dismounted from a number of carriages in a beautiful
    grove hard by. It consisted mostly of noble-looking
    boys and beautiful girls, of all ages under fourteen, the
    latter dressed in white and crowned with wreaths of roses
    and other flowers. The manly attention of the boys to
    the fair creatures with whom they walked hand in hand
    would not have disgraced the gallantry of Bayard, or the
    politeness of Chesterfield. As the procession wound
    slowly from our view, under the shade of the lofty live
    oak and the rich magnolia, we could not help reflecting
    how beautiful was this graceful enjoyment of the sunny
    days of childhood, and how preferable to the mental excitement
    and precocious training of many of the infant
    philosophers of this most enlightened nineteenth century.</p>
<p>It is much to be regretted that in circles where fashion
    reigns supreme, nature is gradually giving way to art,
    and instead of the fresh and natural beauty of a newly
    gathered Rose, various forms of artificial flowers are found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> upon the center table, or in the hair of those whose quick
    discernment and refined taste should lead them to perceive
    the great inferiority of these artificial toys to the
    delicate beauty and welcome fragrance of a Rose just
    from its parent plant.</p>
<p>Very much additional matter could be inserted respecting
    the early history of the Rose, and its connection with
    ancient superstitions. Sufficient, however, has been given
    to show the esteem in which the Rose was held by the
    ancient Greeks and Romans.</p>
<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>
<h3>THE ROSE IN THE MIDDLE AGES.</h3>
<p>In Great Britain, according to Loudon, &ldquo;one of the
    earliest notices of the Rose occurs in Chaucer, who wrote
    early in the 13th century; and in the beginning of the
    15th century, there is evidence of the Rose having been
    cultivated for commercial purposes, and of the water distilled
    from it being used to give a flavor to a variety of
    dishes, and to wash the hands at meals&mdash;a custom still
    preserved in some of the colleges, and also in many of the
    public halls within the city of London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1402, Sir William Clopton granted to Thomas
    Smyth a piece of ground called Dokmedwe, in Haustede,
    for the annual payment of a rose to Sir William and his
    heirs, in lieu of all services. The demand for roses formerly
    was so great, that bushels of them were frequently
    paid by vassals to their lords, both in England and France.
    The single rose, paid as an acknowledgment, was the
    diminutive representation of a bushel of roses&mdash;as a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> peppercorn, which is still a reserved rent, represents a
    pound of peppercorns&mdash;a payment originally of some
    worth, but descending by degrees to a mere formality.
    Among the new-year gifts presented to Queen Mary in
    1556, was a bottle of rose-water; and in 1570 we find,
    among the items in the account of a dinner of Lord Leicester,
    when he was Chancellor of the University of Oxford,
    three ounces of rose-water. In an account of a grant
    of a great part of Ely House, Holborne, by the Bishop of
    Ely, to Christopher Hatton, for twenty-one years, the
    tenant covenants to pay, on midsummer-day, a red rose
    for the gate-house and garden, and for the ground (fourteen
    acres) ten loads of hay and £10 per annum; the
    Bishop reserving to himself and successors free access
    through the gate-house, for walking in the gardens and
    gathering twenty bushels of roses yearly. In 1597, we
    find Gerard speaking of the Damask rose of Damascus
    and the Cinnamon rose as common in English gardens.
    Hakluyt says that the rose of Damascus was brought to
    England by De Linaker, physician to Henry IX.; and his
    successor, Sir Richard Weston, who wrote in 1645, says,
    &ldquo;We have red roses from France.&rdquo; In the reign of
    James I., the keeper of the robes and jewels at Whitehall,
    among a variety of other offices, had separate salaries allowed
    him, &ldquo;for fire to air the hot-houses, 40s. by the
    year;&rdquo; and, &ldquo;for digging and setting of roses, in the
    spring gardens, 40s. by the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would seem, by these incidents, that previous to the
    seventeenth century, roses were far from being abundant,
    and indeed were so rare, that a bottle of distilled water
    was a fit present for Royalty, and a few roses an amply
    sufficient rent for house and land.</p>
<p>In the times of chivalry, the Rose was often an emblem
    that knights were fond of placing in their helmet or shield,
    implying that sweetness should always be the companion
    of courage, and that beauty was the only prize worthy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> valor. It was not, however, always taken for such emblems,
    nor did it always bring to mind pleasant and agreeable
    images, but was often the signal for bloodshed in a
    desolating civil war which raged in England for more than
    thirty years.</p>
<p>The rival factions of the <i>White</i> and the <i>Red</i> Rose arose
    in 1452, during the reign of Henry VI., between the
    houses of Lancaster and of York. The Duke of York, a
    descendant of Edward III., claimed that his house possessed
    a nearer title to the crown than the reigning branch.
    He adopted a <i>white</i> rose on his shield, for his device, and
    the reigning monarch, Henry VI., of the house of Lancaster,
    carried the <i>red</i> rose. After several furious civil
    wars, after having flooded the whole kingdom with blood,
    and after the tragical death of three kings, Henry VII.,
    of the house of Lancaster, re-united, in 1486, the two families
    by marrying Elizabeth, the heiress of the house of
    York.</p>
<p>The adoption of the red rose, by the house of Lancaster,
    was at a period far prior to these civil wars. About 1277,
    the Count of Egmont, son of the King of England, and
    who had taken the title of Count of Champagne, was sent
    by the King of France to Provence, with some troops, to
    avenge the murder of William Pentecôte, mayor of the
    city, who had been killed in an insurrection.</p>
<p>When this prince returned into England, after executing
    his orders, he took for his device the red rose, that
    Thibaut, Count of Brie and of Champagne, had brought
    from Syria, on his return from the crusade some years
    before.&mdash;That Count of Egmont was the head of the
    house of Lancaster, who preserved the red rose on their
    arms, while the house of York, on the other hand, adopted
    the white rose as their device.</p>
<p>An anecdote is told of the Prince of Bearne, afterwards
    Henry IV. of France, who was not 15 years of age when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> Charles IX. came to Nerac, in 1566, to visit the court of
    Navarre.</p>
<p>The fifteen days that he spent there were marked by
    sports and fêtes, of which the young Henry was already
    the chief ornament. Charles IX. loved to practice archery;
    in providing for him that amusement, they thought
    that none of his courtiers, not even the Duke of Guise,
    who excelled at this sport, would venture to prove himself
    more adroit than the monarch. The young Henry, however,
    advanced, and at the first shot, carried off the orange,
    which served for a mark. According to the rules of the
    sport, be wished, as victor, to shoot first in the next trial;
    the King opposed it, and repulsed him with warmth;
    Henry stepped back a little, drew his bow, and directed
    the arrow against the breast of his adversary; the monarch
    quickly took shelter behind the largest of his courtiers,
    and requested them to take away &ldquo;that dangerous little
    cousin.&rdquo; Peace being made, the same sport was continued
    on the following day; Charles found an excuse for not
    coming. This time the Duke of Guise carried away the
    orange, which he split in two, and no other could be found
    for a mark.</p>
<p>The young prince perceived a Rose in the bosom of a
    young girl among the spectators, and seizing it, quickly
    placed it on the mark. The Duke shot first, and missed;
    Henry succeeding him, placed his arrow in the middle of
    the flower, and returned it to the pretty villager with the
    victorious arrow which had pierced it.</p>
<p>At Salency, a village of France, the Rose is the reward
    of excellent traits of character; they attribute the origin
    of the fête of La Rosière, in that country, to Medard,
    bishop of Noyon, who lived at the end of the fifteenth,
    and beginning of the sixteenth century, during the reign
    of Clovis. That bishop, who was also Lord of Salency,
    had established a fund, giving a sum of twenty-five livres
    (five dollars), and a crown or hat of roses, to the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> girl on his estate who enjoyed the greatest reputation for
    amiability and excellence of character. Tradition states
    that the prelate himself gave this desired prize to one of
    his sisters, whom the public voice had named to be Rosière.
    Before the revolution of 1789, there could be seen, beneath
    the altar of the chapel of St. Medard, at Salency, a tablet,
    where that bishop was represented in pontifical dress, and
    placing a crown of roses on the head of his sister, who
    was on her knees, with her hair dressed.</p>
<p>The bishop had set aside, on a part of his domain, since
    called the &ldquo;Manor of the Rose,&rdquo; an annual rent of twenty-five
    livres, at that time a considerable sum, for paying
    all the expenses of this ceremony. It is stated that Louis
    XIII., being at the chateau of Varennes, near Salency,
    about the time of this ceremony, was desirous of adding
    to its <i>éclat</i> by his personal presence; but finding himself
    indisposed, he sent to La Rosière, by a marquis of rank
    and first captain of his guards, a ring and his blue ribbon.
    &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; said he to the marquis, &ldquo;and present this riband
    to her who shall be crowned. It has been long the prize
    of honor; it shall now become the reward of virtue.&rdquo;
    Since that time La Rosière has received a ring, and she
    and her companions have worn the blue ribbon.</p>
<p>The Lord of Salency at one time enjoyed the right of
    choosing La Rosière from three of the village girls, who
    were presented by the inhabitants. But in 1773 a new
    lord, who purchased the estate of Salency, wished to take
    away the right enjoyed by the inhabitants, of naming and
    presenting to him the three candidates for the Rose. He
    assumed the nomination of La Rosière, without any assembling,
    election, or presentation, and suppressed entirely
    the pomp and ceremonies which until that time had always
    been observed. On the complaint of the inhabitants
    of Salency, the Court of Chancery at once set aside
    the pretensions of their lord; but he, not wishing to yield
    them, instituted a civil process before the Parliament of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> Paris, which gave a decree in favor of the inhabitants of
    the place, by which it confirmed to them all the ancient
    customs of the fête of La Rosière, of which the Lord of
    Salency was ordered to pay all the expenses.</p>
<p>The ceremony of La Rosière was suppressed during
    the excesses of the Revolution, but was reëstablished
    when the times had become more quiet. The celebration
    takes place in June, and would be well worthy the attendance
    of foreign travelers.</p>
<p>We have mentioned this custom very much in detail,
    as it is one of the few ceremonies still existing, in which
    the Rose occupies a prominent position, and is made alone
    the reward of merit. Other festivals of the Rose, similar
    to those of Salency, were established in several other villages
    of France and the neighboring countries. When
    Louis XVIII. was staying at Blakenbourg, in Germany,
    during the years of his exile, he was invited to assist at a
    festival of La Rosière. When he had placed the crown
    on the head of the young girl who was designated as the
    most virtuous, she said to him, ingenuously, &ldquo;My Prince,
    may <i>your</i> crown be restored you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There exists a touching custom in the valley of Engadine,
    in Switzerland. If a man accused of a crime is able
    to justify himself the same day on which he is liberated
    from prison, a young and beautiful girl offers him a white
    rose, called the Rose of Innocence.</p>
<p>It is somewhat singular that, although the Rose was in
    these instances employed as the emblem of virtue and innocence,
    it has been considered, at other times and places,
    as a sign of disgrace and dishonor.</p>
<p>The synod held at Nismes, about the year 1284, ordered
    the Jews to wear on their breast a rose, to distinguish
    them from Christians, in order that they might not receive
    the same attentions. At one time, in certain German
    provinces, a crown of red roses was the punishment of
    immorality.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>
<p>It appears that, in the Middle Ages, roses were much
    more abundantly cultivated in certain provinces than they
    have been since; for the following passage is found in
    Marchangy&rsquo;s History of France in the 14th century:
    &ldquo;For the ornament of certain festivals, they cultivate, in
    the vicinity of Rouen, fields of flowers of several rods:
    and the annual sale of bouquets and wreaths of roses is
    valued at 50,000 francs. The business of <i>maker of
    wreaths</i>, and that of <i>rose merchant</i>, is in France very
    common and very profitable. The above sum will not
    seem surprising, when we think of the enormous consumption
    of rose-water at that time. In all family parties,
    companies, and associations, many bouquets were presented;
    at table, during festivals, they crowned themselves
    with flowers, and scattered them on the table-cloth and
    the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marquis de Chesnel, in his History of the Rose,
    mentions that, among the old customs of Auvergne, Anjou,
    Tours, Lodunois, and Maine, there was one in the noble
    families, that a father who had sons, frequently gave
    to his daughters, on their marriage, only a wreath of
    roses. In Normandy, also, the daughters received, for
    their legitimate portion, a hat adorned with the same
    flowers. Among the ancient seigneurial rights in France,
    in the 14th century, was one by which each tenant was
    obliged to furnish a bushel of roses for the manufacture
    of rose-water for the lord of the soil. Madame de Genlis
    mentions, however, that about the same period, every one
    was not allowed to cultivate these flowers; but permission
    to do so was granted to privileged persons. Whether it
    was ever a royal monopoly she does not state; but it
    would certainly be no more singular than the monopoly
    of the sale of butter by the King of Naples.</p>
<p>We have already mentioned the wars of the White and
    Red Rose, which during so long a time deluged England
    with blood. There is also an instance in French history,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> where this flower, associated as it is with innocence and
    pleasant thoughts, served, under the reign of Charles VI.,
    as the rallying sign of the faction of Burgundy against
    that of Armagnac. The Parisians, urged by the agents
    of the Duke of Burgundy, established the order of St.
    André for their partisans, in order to manage them more
    easily; and the church of St. Eustache was chosen as
    their rendezvous. Each church member wore a crown of
    red roses, of which more than seven hundred were made
    in the space of twelve hours, and the flowers were sufficiently
    abundant to perfume the whole church.</p>
<p>According to an ancient custom, the dukes and peers of
    France were formerly obliged to present roses to the Parliament
    of Paris, at certain periods of its session. The
    peer who was chosen to do the honors of this ceremony
    caused all the chambers of Parliament to be scattered with
    roses, flowers, and fragrant herbs; and entertained at a
    splendid breakfast the presidents, councilors, and even the
    notaries and door-keepers of the court. He afterwards
    went into each chamber, accompanied by a page with a
    large silver basin, which contained as many bouquets of
    roses and other flowers as there were public officers, with
    an equal number of crowns composed of the same flowers.
    The Parliament also had its cultivator of roses, called the <i>Rosièr de la Cour</i>, from whom the peers could obtain the
    roses for their presents.</p>
<p>Under the reign of Francis I., in 1541, there was a dispute
    between the Duc de Montpensier and the Duc de
    Nevers respecting the presentage of the roses to Parliament.
    It was decided that the Duc de Montpensier, from
    his rank as prince of the blood, should be entitled to
    the first presentage. Among the princes of the royal
    family who submitted to this ceremony at later periods,
    are numbered the dukes of Vendome, Beaumont, Angouleme,
    and several other distinguished names. Henry IV.,
    while only King of Navarre, proved to the procureur-general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> that neither he nor his predecessors had ever failed
    to perform that duty.</p>
<p>About the year 1631, there was published a very curious
    book on the Rose, by a German named Rosenberg.
    About 250 octavo pages are devoted entirely to the praise
    of the curative properties of the Rose in almost every
    known disease, making, in fact, this flower a universal
    panacea for the many ills to which flesh is heir. The author
    also claims for it supernatural qualities, particularly
    for driving away evil spirits. The work closes by asserting,
    as a positive fact, supported by several authorities
    which he quotes, the remarkable regeneration or resurrection
    of the Rose. He gives also the process of this reproduction,
    which is scarcely worth inserting here, being,
    like the story of the Ph&#339;nix, a fable engendered by superstition
    upon ignorance. It is somewhat surprising that
    this fable should have been very gravely reproduced, in a
    French work on the Rose, published in 1800. The author
    states that, &ldquo;notwithstanding the many marvelous things
    which we already know respecting the improving, forcing,
    changing, and multiplying of roses, we have yet to describe
    the most surprising of all&mdash;that of its regeneration;
    or, in other words, the manner of reproducing that flower
    from its own ashes. This is called the <i>imperial secret</i>, because
    the Emperor Ferdinand III. purchased it of a foreign
    chemist, at a very high price.&rdquo; The conclusion is a rather
    amusing instance of Munchausenism in the 19th century.
    &ldquo;Finally, all this material being placed in a glass vessel,
    with a certain quantity of pure dew, forms a blue powder,
    from which, when heat is applied, there springs a stem,
    leaves, and flowers, and a whole and perfect plant is formed
    from its own ashes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is difficult to credit the fact that, in any part of this
    enlightened age, an author could be found who would
    gravely and in sincerity advance such opinions and state
    such facts as the above; and it is but an additional proof,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> if such were wanting, that nothing can be advanced too
    monstrous or too incredible to be entirely without believers.</p>
<p>If the sight of roses, or their delicate fragrance, has
    been generally delightful and pleasing, there have also
    been those who could not endure them. Anne of Austria,
    wife of Louis XIII., of France, although otherwise very
    fond of perfumes, had such an antipathy to the rose, that
    she could not bear the sight of one even in a painting.
    The Duke of Guise had a still stronger dislike, for he always
    made his escape at the sight of a rose. Dr. Ladelius
    mentions a man who was obliged to become a recluse, and
    dared not leave his house, during the season of roses; because,
    if he happened to imbibe their fragrance, he was
    immediately seized with a violent cold in his head.</p>
<p>The odor of the rose, like that of many other flowers,
    has often occasioned serious injury, particularly in closed
    apartments; and persons to whose sensitive organizations
    the odor is disagreeable should not sleep with them in the
    chamber. Some authors of credibility mention instances
    of death caused by a large quantity of roses being left
    during the night in a sleeping apartment.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>
<h3>PERFUMES OF THE ROSE.</h3>
<p>At an early period in the cultivation of the Rose, and
    after its admission among the luxuries of the wealthy,
    human skill was exerted to extract its delightful perfume.</p>
<p>Several authors have considered the invention of the
    essence of the Rose very ancient, and have even traced it
    back as far as the siege of Troy. This, however, can
    scarcely be admitted, for nothing relating to the essence
    or essential oil of roses can be found in Homer, or in any
    other author for many subsequent years. The discovery
    of these valuable articles of commerce was made at a
    much later period. If the essential oil of roses had been
    known to the ancient Greeks or Romans, it would probably
    have been more particularly mentioned by Pliny, and
    the mode of preparation even would have been described.
    In speaking, however, of various perfumes, he says nothing
    of any distillation from the petals of the Rose, but
    simply mentions that, as early as the siege of Troy, the <i>expressed</i> juice of roses was known, and being mixed with
    a delicate oil, formed an agreeable perfume.</p>
<p>In speaking of artificial oils in general, Pliny also observes
    that the oil of roses was made by simply steeping
    the rose-petals in oil. According to the same author, oil
    was the body of nearly all the perfumes used at that day,
    and for a perfuming substance, roses were most frequently
    used, because they grew everywhere in the greatest
    abundance.</p>
<p>Perfumes of every kind were more abundantly used
    among the ancient Greeks and Romans than at the present
    day. Athenæus, in his <i>Feast of Wise Men</i>, states<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> that nearly all of these were drawn from the Rose, and
    says that the most sweet were those of Cyrene, while
    those of Naples, Capua, and Faseoli were the best and
    most delightful of all.</p>
<p>This agrees with the subsequent researches made on
    the same subject by D&rsquo;Orbessan. &ldquo;The cities of Naples,
    Capua, and Preneste,&rdquo; says the latter, &ldquo;obtained their
    roses from Campania, where there is yet a considerable
    tract of land, commonly called <i>Il mazzone delle Rose</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This field is sometimes called <i>Rosetinus</i>, on account
    of the prodigious quantity of roses which grow there
    without culture, and in greater abundance than in any
    other section of that country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Athenæus states that the perfume of roses was frequently
    used in culinary preparations, and gives a curious receipt
    for a sort of <i>pot-pourri</i>, made by the cook of the
    King of Sicily. &ldquo;This is what I call <i>potted roses</i>, and it is
    thus prepared: I first pound some of the most fragrant
    roses in a mortar; then I take the brains of birds and
    pigs, well boiled and stripped of every particle of meat;
    I then add the yolks of some eggs, some oil, a little cordial,
    some pepper, and some wine: after having beaten
    and mixed it well together, I throw it in a new pot, and
    place it over a slow but steady fire.&rdquo; &ldquo;As he said these
    things,&rdquo; so runs the story, &ldquo;the cook uncovered the pot,
    and there issued forth a most delicious fragrance, perfuming
    the whole dining-hall, and overcoming the guests with
    delight.&rdquo; This is a point in gastronomic luxury to which
    Americans have not yet attained.</p>
<p>Although the perfume of roses was considered more
    choice than any other, it was frequently used when men
    were least in the state to enjoy it; for D&rsquo;Orbessan states
    that slaves were made to burn it around their masters
    while sleeping.</p>
<p>If the essential oil of roses had been known in the time
    of Pliny, that author would have mentioned it among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> most esteemed and precious perfumes. So far from this,
    however, he only speaks of the &ldquo;Royal Perfume,&rdquo; so
    called because it was prepared expressly for the King of
    the Parthians. This was composed of the oil of Ben, an
    Arabian tree, with several aromatic substances. According
    to Langles, who has carefully examined a great number
    of oriental works, no writer, previous to the sixteenth
    century, has mentioned the essential oil of roses, although
    these flowers abounded at that time, and mention is made
    of rose-water as an agreeable perfume. Besides these
    negative proofs against the ancient existence of this perfume,
    Langles quotes several oriental historians, from
    which it seems evident that its discovery dates about the
    year 1612, and was owing entirely to accident.</p>
<p>According to Father Catron, in his <i>History of the
    Mogul Empire</i>, in the fêtes which the sultana Nourmahal
    gave to the great Mogul, Jehan-guire, their chief pleasure
    was sailing together in a canal which Nourmahal had
    filled with rose-water.</p>
<p>One day that the Emperor was thus sailing with Nourmahal,
    they perceived a sort of froth forming and floating
    upon the water. They drew it out, and perceived that it
    was the essential oil which the heat of the sun had disengaged
    from the water and collected together on the surface.
    The whole seraglio pronounced the perfume the
    most exquisite known in the Indies; and they immediately
    endeavored to imitate by art that which nature had
    made. Thus was discovered the essence, essential oil,
    otto, or attar of roses.</p>
<p>According to Langles, the word <i>A&rsquo;ther</i>, <i>A&rsquo;thr</i>, or <i>Othr</i>,
    which the Arabs, Turks, and Persians use to designate
    the essential oil of Roses without adding the name of
    that flower, is Arabic, and signifies perfume. It is necessary,
    the same author states, to recollect the distinction
    between <i>A&rsquo;ther</i>, or <i>A&rsquo;ther gul</i> and <i>gulab</i>, which is simply
    rose-water.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>
<p>From the very small quantity congealed on the surface
    of the water, the manufacture is limited, and the cost of
    the article immense. Langles states that the rose-water is
    left exposed to the freshness of the night, and in the
    morning a very small quantity of attar is found collected
    on the surface.</p>
<p>Dr. Monro, according to Loudon, gives the manner of
    making the attar in Cashmere, which is apparently more
    simple, without the tedious process of distilling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rose-petals are put into a wooden vessel with pure
    water, and exposed for several days to the heat of the
    sun. The oily particles, being disengaged by the heat,
    float upon the surface of the water, whence they are taken
    up from time to time by applying to them some very fine
    dry cotton wool. From this wool the oil is pressed into
    little bottles, which are immediately afterwards sealed
    hermetically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another method is, exposing the rose-water to heat,
    then suddenly cooling it, and collecting the drops of congealed
    oil which float upon the surface.</p>
<p>Bishop Heber describes the method used in India, which
    is very similar to that of Langles. The attar has the consistency
    of butter, and never becomes liquid except in the
    warmest weather.</p>
<p>Loudon states that &ldquo;a wretched substitute for otto of
    roses is said to be formed by the apothecaries of Paris.
    The petals of <i>Rosa Damascena</i> are boiled in a large caldron
    of water along with as much hog&rsquo;s lard as will cover
    its surface with a thin stratum of grease. The oil of the
    rose-petals, on separating from them by boiling, unites
    with this grease, from which it is again separated by spirits
    of wine.&rdquo; A large portion of the attar imported into
    the United States is probably of this manufacture.</p>
<p>The quantity of genuine attar produced from a given
    weight of rose-petals is not always the same; it is very
    liable to vary according to the nature of the climate, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> temperature of different seasons, the period of bloom at
    which the roses are picked, the process of manufacture,
    and the skill of the manufacturers. Generally, a hundred
    pounds of roses will scarcely produce a drachm of attar,
    sometimes only half a drachm, and at others a drachm
    and a half. Bishop Heber states that in India, at Ghazepoor,
    two hundred thousand well-grown roses are required
    to produce one rupee&rsquo;s (165 grains) weight of attar.
    The calyx is sometimes used with the petal, but as the oil
    of that contains little or no perfume, although it may increase
    the quantity of attar, it must sensibly weaken its
    properties.</p>
<p>The color of attar is generally green, sometimes lemon
    or rose color, and occasionally brownish. These differences
    in color are owing to the various processes of manufacture,
    and the different periods at which the roses are
    picked. The attar is prepared in Barbary, Syria, Arabia,
    Persia, India, in the island of Scio, at Fayoum, in Egypt,
    at Tunis, and many other places in the East. That made
    in Syria and Barbary is considered very inferior; while
    the best is made in Chyraz, Kerman, and Cashmere. In
    some parts of France and Italy it is also prepared, but in
    comparatively small quantities.</p>
<p>The attar is very costly, although not so dear as formerly.
    The French traveler, Tavernier, who visited Ispahan
    about the year 1666, stated that the price of attar at
    Chyraz rose and fell every year on account of the unequal
    produce of flowers; and that an ounce of that article
    sold, at one period, for ten tomans (about ninety-two
    dollars).</p>
<p>At the time another Frenchman, Chardin, traveled in
    Persia, some years after Tavernier, the attar was sometimes
    much higher. He states that forty pounds of rose-water
    were required to produce half a drachm of attar,
    an ounce of which sometimes sold in India for two hundred
    ecus. Langles states that in India half an ounce of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> attar is worth about forty dollars. Bishop Heber also
    speaks of its enormous price at Ghazepoor, where the
    variation in price is also very great, being, according to
    Langles, sometimes as low as eight dollars an ounce.</p>
<p>At one time, soon after its discovery, it was valued at
    about five times its weight in gold. Until quite recently,
    it was worth its weight in gold, but now sells in Paris for
    about one quarter that value.</p>
<p>Attar is rarely found pure in commerce; it is always
    more or less adulterated. In the countries where it is
    manufactured, they frequently increase the quantity of
    the attar by mixing scrapings of sandal-wood with the
    rose-petals during the process of distillation Kæmpfer,
    a German writer, states this mode of adulteration to have
    been known a long time, and adds that the sandal-wood
    gives additional strength to the attar; but another author,
    who has also made some researches on the subject,
    asserts that the sandal-wood injures the delicacy of the
    attar, which is more sweet and agreeable when mild than
    when strong.</p>
<p>The quality as well as the quantity of attar which they
    obtain from roses depends upon the proportion of aroma
    which they contain; and this is found more developed at
    the South, and in a warm climate. The kinds of roses
    used in distillation have also a great influence on the
    quality of the attar. In Persia and the East, the Musk
    Rose is generally used, and the Damask is employed in
    France.</p>
<p>Although roses are distilled in large quantities at Paris
    for perfumery and for medical purposes, very little attar
    is made, because the proportion of the manufactured article
    to the roses required is, in that climate, extremely
    small; so small, in fact, that, according to one writer, five
    thousand parts in weight of rose-petals will scarcely produce
    one part of essential oil. This limited manufacture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> exists only at Grasse and Montpelier, in France, and at
    Florence, in Italy.</p>
<p>Some years since, the adulteration of attar was successfully
    practiced in the south of France by mixing with it
    the essence distilled from the leaves of the Rose Geranium
    (<i>Pelargonium capitatum</i>). This adulteration is very
    difficult to detect, because this last essence possesses the
    same properties as the attar; its odor is almost the same;
    like that, it is of a lemon color; it crystalizes at a lower
    temperature; and its density is very little greater.</p>
<p>The attar, when pure, is, beyond comparison, the most
    sweet and agreeable of all perfumes. Its fragrance is the
    most delicate conceivable, and equals that of the freshly
    expanded Rose. It is also so strong and penetrating,
    that a single drop, or as much as will attach itself to the
    point of a needle, is sufficient to perfume an apartment for
    several days; and if the small flask in which it is sold,
    although tightly corked and sealed, is placed in a drawer,
    it will perfume all the contents.</p>
<p>When in a congealed or crystalized state, the attar will
    liquefy at a slight heat; and if the flask is merely held in
    the hand, a few minutes will suffice to render it liquid.
    In the East much use is made of the attar, particularly in
    the harems. In Europe and America it is employed in
    the manufacture of cordials, and in the preparation of
    various kinds of perfumery.</p>
<p>Rose-water, or the liquid obtained from rose-petals by
    distillation, is very common, and is found in almost every
    country where the arts and luxuries of life have at all
    advanced.</p>
<p>Pliny tells us that rose-water was a favorite perfume of
    the Roman ladies, and the most luxurious used it even in
    their baths. This, however, must have been some preparation
    different from that now known as rose-water, and
    was probably a mere tincture of roses.</p>
<p>The ancients could have known nothing of rose-water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> for they were entirely ignorant of the art of distillation,
    which only came into practice after the invention of the
    alembic by the Arabs. Some attribute this discovery to
    Rhazes, an Arabian physician, who lived in the early part
    of the tenth century; and others attribute it to Avicenna,
    who lived at Chyraz, in the latter part of the same century.
    It is also attributed to Geber, a celebrated Arabian
    alchemist, who lived in Mesopotamia in the eighth century.
    Subsequent, therefore, to this discovery of the
    alembic, we find, according to Gmelin, in his history of
    the preparation of distilled waters, that the first notice
    of rose-water is by Aben-Zohar, a Jewish physician, of
    Seville, in Spain, who recommends it for diseases of the
    eye. From the Arabs, this invention passed among the
    Greeks and Romans, as we are informed by Actuarius, a
    writer of the eleventh or twelfth century.</p>
<p>In France, the first distillation of rose-water appears to
    have been made by Arnaud de Villeneuve, a physician,
    who lived in the latter part of the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>The Orientals made great use of this water in various
    ways in their houses, and in the purification of their temples
    when they thought they had been profaned by any
    other worship than that of Mahomet. There are many
    anecdotes told by historians of the use of rose-water by
    the Sultans on various occasions; and several of these, as
    Chateaubriand remarks, are stories worthy of the East.
    It is related of Saladin, that when he took Jerusalem from
    the Crusaders, in 1187, he would not enter the Mosque of
    Omar, which had been converted into a church by the
    Christians, until the walls and courts had been thoroughly
    washed and purified with rose-water brought from Damascus.
    Five hundred camels, it is stated, were scarcely
    sufficient to convey all the rose-water used for this purpose.
    An Arabian writer tells us that the princes of the
    family of Saladin, hastening to Jerusalem to worship
    Aliah, Malek-Abdul, and his nephew, Taki-Eddin, distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> themselves above all others. The latter repaired
    with all his followers to the &ldquo;Chapel of the Holy Cross,&rdquo;
    and taking a broom himself, he swept all the dirt from
    the floor, washed the walls and the ceiling several times
    with pure water, and then washed them with rose-water;
    having thus cleansed and purified the place, he distributed
    large alms to the poor.</p>
<p>Bibars, the fourth Sultan of the Mameluke dynasty,
    who reigned from 1260 to 1277, caused the Caaba of the
    temple of Mecca to be washed with rose-water.</p>
<p>Mahomet II., after the capture of Constantinople, in
    1453, would not enter the Mosque of St. Sophia, which
    had been formerly used as a church, until he had caused
    it to be washed with rose-water.</p>
<p>It is stated by a French historian that the greatest display
    of gorgeous magnificence at that period was made in
    1611, by the Sultan Ahmed I., at the dedication of the
    new Caaba, which had been built or repaired at his expense;
    amber and aloes were burnt in profusion, and, in
    the extravagance of Eastern language, oceans of rose-water
    were set afloat, for washing the courts and interior
    surface of the walls. Rose-water is by no means so generally
    used now as for a few hundred years subsequent to
    its invention. In France, during the reign of Philip Augustus,
    it was a necessary article at court. It was formerly
    the custom to carry large vases filled with rose-water
    to baptisms. Illustrating this custom, Bayle relates a
    story of Rousard, the French poet: &ldquo;It nearly happened
    that the day of his birth was also that of his death; for
    when he was carried from the Chateau de La Poissoniére
    to the church of the place to be baptized, the nurse who
    carried him carelessly let him fall; his fall, however, was
    upon the grass and flowers, which received him softly; it
    so happened, that a young lady, who carried a vase filled
    with rose-water and a collection of flowers, in her haste
    to aid in helping the child, overturned on his head a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> part of the rose-water. This incident was considered a
    presage of the good odor with which France would one
    day be filled by the flowers of his learned writings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At one time rose-water was largely consumed in the
    preparation of food and the seasoning of various dishes.
    In the &ldquo;Private Life of the French,&rdquo; it is mentioned that
    in the fourteenth century, the Comte d&rsquo;Etampes gave a
    feast in which a large part of the dishes and even the
    chestnuts were prepared with rose-water. It is still used
    to flavor various dishes, but its principal use is in affections
    of the eyelids, or as a perfume for the toilet. The
    principal consumption of rose-water is, however, in the
    East, where the inhabitants are very fond of perfumes.
    In Persia a very large quantity is made annually for domestic
    use. They deem it an excellent beverage mixed
    with pure water.</p>
<p>The Corinth Grape, mixed with rose-water, and a slight
    infusion of spices, is the nectar so much in vogue among
    the Greeks of Morea. The Persians, according to Lebruyn,
    sprinkle with rose-water those who visit them.
    They also make it an important article of commerce;
    large quantities are sent to different parts of the East,
    and entire cargoes are sometimes shipped to India.</p>
<p>In Egypt, the nobles and wealthy inhabitants consume
    large quantities of rose-water; they scatter it over their
    divans and other places where they spend their time; they
    also offer it with confectionery to their visitors.</p>
<p>The custom of offering rose-water to a guest is alluded
    to by Shakespeare, who makes one of his characters in
    Padua say:</p>
<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&ldquo;What is it your honor will command?<br />
        </span> <span class="i1">Let one attend him with a silver bason<br />
        </span> <span class="i1">Full of <i>rose-water</i>, and bestrewed with flowers.&rdquo;<br />
        </span> </div>
</div>
<p>Almost all the rose-water used in Egypt is distilled in
    the province of Fayoum, from the pale rose. &ldquo;About the
    middle of February, in Fayoum,&rdquo; says a French writer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> &ldquo;they pluck the roses every morning before sunrise,
    while the dew is yet upon them; they then place them
    immediately in the alembic, not allowing them to become
    dry or heated by remaining too long a time without distillation.
    This lucrative branch of manufacture has not
    escaped the monopoly of Mehemet Ali. No private individual
    can now distil roses in Egypt, and those who cultivate
    them are obliged to sell the petals to government at
    a low price. The value of all the rose-water distilled in
    Fayoum, annually, is estimated at 50,000 or 60,000 francs.&rdquo;
    Of the profusion with which rose-water is used in India,
    some idea may be formed from the narrative of Bishop
    Heber, who was shown, in the ruins of the palace of
    Ghazepoor, a deep trench round an octagonal platform of
    blue, red, and white mosaic pavement. This trench, he
    was told, was filled with rose-water when the Nawâb and
    his friends were feasting in the middle. &ldquo;The ancient oil
    of roses,&rdquo; according to Loudon, &ldquo;is obtained by bruising
    fresh rose-petals, mixing them with four times their
    weight of olive oil, and leaving them in a sand-heat for
    two days. If the red Rose of Provence is used, the oil is
    said to imbibe no odor; but if the petals of pale roses are
    employed, it becomes perfumed. This preparation was
    celebrated among the ancients. Pliny says that, according
    to Homer, roses were macerated for their oil in the
    time of the Trojans. The oil is chiefly used for the hair,
    and is generally sold in perfumers&rsquo; shops, both in France
    and England, under the name of <i>L&rsquo;huile antique de Rose</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spirit of roses is made by distilling rose-petals with a
    small quantity of spirits of wine, and forms an agreeable
    article for external applications. The green leaves of the
    sweet-brier are sometimes, in France, steeped in spirits of
    wine to impart a fragrance; and in England they are frequently
    used to flavor cowslip wine.</p>
<p>As the petals of the rose preserve their fragrance for a
    long time after being dried, many are in the habit of making,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> annually, little bags filled with them. These, being
    placed in a drawer or wardrobe, impart an agreeable perfume
    to the linen or clothing with which they may come
    in contact. The petals can be obtained from almost any
    garden in sufficient quantity for this purpose, and can be
    dried by the process mentioned hereafter. The confectioners,
    distillers, and perfumers of France draw from the
    Rose a part of their perfumes, particularly from <i>R. Damascena</i>,
    and <i>R. centifolia</i>, in fixing their sweet odors in
    sugar-plums, creams, ices, oils, pomatum, essences, and
    fragrant powders.</p>
<p>The petals of the Rose, after being freshly picked and
    bruised in a marble mortar, until they are reduced to a
    sort of paste, are employed in the preparation of different
    kinds of confectionery. Of this paste the French also
    make little perfume balls of the size of a pea. They are
    made round in the same manner as pills, and before becoming
    hard, they are pierced with a needle and strung
    on a piece of silk. In a little while they become hard
    like wood, assume a brownish color, and emit a delightful
    perfume. This rose scent continues very long, and one
    writer remarks that he has known a necklace made in this
    style, possess, at the end of twenty-five years, as strong a
    perfume as when first made.</p>
<p>In Great Britain, in the vicinity of the large cities, and
    in many private gardens, the flowers are gathered for
    making rose-water or for drying as perfumes. In Holland,
    the Dutch <i>hundred-leaved</i> and common <i>cabbage rose</i> are grown extensively at Noordwich, between Leyden
    and Haarlem, and the dried leaves are sent to Amsterdam
    and Constantinople. In France, the Provence Rose is extensively
    cultivated near the town of Provence, about sixty
    miles south-east of Paris, and also at Fontenay aux Roses,
    near Paris, for the manufacture of rose-water, or for exportation
    in a dried state. The petals of the Provence
    Rose (<i>Rosa Gallica</i>) are the only ones that are said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> gain additional fragrance in drying; all the other varieties
    losing in this process more or less of their perfume.
    A French writer states, that apothecaries employ both
    pale and red roses; the pale give more perfume, while the
    red keep the longer.</p>
<p>Loudon states that &ldquo;the petals of roses ought always
    to be gathered as soon as the flower is fully expanded;
    and the gathering should never be deferred until it has
    begun to fade, because, in the latter case, the petals are
    not only discolored, but weakened in their perfume and
    their medical properties. They should be immediately
    separated from the calyx, and the claws of the petals
    pinched off; they are then dried in the shade, if the
    weather is dry and warm, or by a stove in a room, if the
    season is humid, care being taken, in either case, not to
    spread them on the ground, but on a platform raised two
    or three feet above it. The drying should be conducted
    expeditiously, because it has been found that slowly dried
    petals do not exhale near so much odor as those which
    have been dried quickly, which is also the case with hay,
    sweet herbs, and odoriferous vegetables generally. After
    the petals are dried, they are freed from any sand, dust, or
    eggs of insects which may adhere to them, by shaking
    them and rubbing them gently in a fine sieve. After this,
    the petals are put into close vessels, from which the air is
    excluded, and which are kept in a dry, airy situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it is extremely difficult to free the rose-petals entirely
    from the eggs of insects, they are taken out of
    these vessels two or three times a year, placed in sieves,
    rubbed, cleaned, and replaced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have been careful to give the details of the above
    process, because it may be useful to those who embark extensively
    in the cultivation of roses for the exportation of
    petals in a dried state. We should suppose that rose-petals
    produced in this latitude, where the Rose has a
    long period of hibernation, would produce more perfume,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> and be more valuable in a dried state than those grown
    under the tropics. The Provence and Damask Rose are
    both known to succeed well here, and to produce abundant
    flowers. Their fragrance is unsurpassed, and our
    summer&rsquo;s sun would be abundantly sufficient to dry the
    petals without any artificial heat. It is not too much to
    hope that the attention of our cultivators may yet be directed
    to this subject, and that the manufacture of rose-water
    and the preparation of dried petals may yet be an
    important branch of domestic industry, and form an important
    addition to the list of exported articles.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>
<h3>THE MEDICAL PROPERTIES OF THE ROSE.</h3>
<p>We have hitherto viewed the Rose as the chief ornament
    of our gardens, and if we have found it abounding
    with charms of fragrance and beauty, we shall now find
    it occupying a prominent place in Materia Medica. Some
    authors have, with a degree of exaggeration, endeavored
    to make its medical as brilliant as its floral reputation.
    Rosenberg, in his work on the Rose, makes it a specific in
    every disease, and even attributes to it supernatural
    virtues.</p>
<p>In the opinion of most medical men, the medicinal properties
    of the Rose are about the same in all the kinds, while
    some writers assert that the <i>Rosa Gallica</i> is superior to
    all others in a greater or less degree. We will mention
    those principally used in medicine, and the properties
    which are especially attributed to each.</p>
<p>The most valuable properties of the Rose reside in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> petals, and in order to preserve these properties, it is
    highly essential that the petals should be quickly and perfectly
    dried. Those of the Provence Rose (<i>Rosa Gallica</i>)
    have an astringent and somewhat bitter taste, and are
    tonic and astringent in their effects.</p>
<p>According to an analysis recently made in France, they
    contain, besides vegetable matter and essential oil, a portion
    of gallic acid, coloring matter, albumen, tannin, some
    salts, with a base of potash or of chalk, silex, and oxide
    of iron. A small dose in powder strengthens the stomach
    and assists digestion. Their prolonged use will sometimes
    cause a slight constipation of the bowels, while in a much
    stronger dose they act as purgatives.</p>
<p>The <i>conserve</i> of the Provence Rose has much reputation
    in France for the treatment of all chronic affections
    of the bowels, caused by weakness and inactivity of the
    digestive organs; it is also employed in colic, in diarrh&#339;a,
    in cases of hemorrhage and leucorrh&#339;a.</p>
<p>The conserve of any variety of roses is considered excellent
    in cases of cold or catarrh. It is prepared by
    bruising in a mortar the petals with their weight in sugar,
    and moistening them with a little rose-water, until the
    whole forms a homogeneous mass. Some receipts prescribe
    powdered petals mixed with an equal part of
    sugar; others direct to use two layers of sugar, and only
    one layer of pulverized petals.</p>
<p>Opoix, a physician of Provence, states that the true Rose
    of Provence has a more sweet and penetrating fragrance
    than the same rose grown elsewhere, and even goes so far
    as to say that it has acquired properties which it does not
    possess in its native country, the Caucasus. On account
    of the supposed superior qualities of this rose, the citizens
    of Provence, in 1807, addressed a petition to government
    to encourage in their territory the cultivation of the true
    Provence Rose, by giving it the preference in all the hospitals
    and military dispensaries. This gave rise to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> discussion between two French chemists, but without deciding
    the fact whether the <i>Rosa Gallica</i> was superior in
    medical properties to any other rose. It seems to be acknowledged
    that those cultivated at Provence were superior
    to the same kind grown elsewhere, and this superiority
    is attributed by some to the presence of iron in the soil
    about that city. It was probably owing, also, to the very
    careful cultivation practiced there. The petals are used
    extensively in several medical preparations, as the sugar
    of roses, the ointment of roses, the treacle of roses, etc.
    Rose-water is, however, more extensively used in medicine
    than any other preparation of the rose. This water,
    when manufactured from <i>Rosa Gallica</i>, or any other of
    the section of <i>Centifoliæ</i>, is employed internally as an
    astringent, and is sometimes mixed with other medicines
    to destroy their disagreeable smell and taste. In external
    applications, it is used principally for affections of the
    eyes, either alone or with some ointment.</p>
<p>The <i>alcoholic tincture of roses</i>, or spirit of roses, before
    mentioned, which was formerly given as a stimulus in
    many cases, has now fallen very much into disuse, medical
    opinion being very much against the employment of
    any alcoholic medicines excepting in very rare cases.</p>
<p>The <i>syrup of roses</i>, manufactured from the pale or Damask
    Rose, is sometimes employed as a purgative, and was
    once highly esteemed and recommended as a mild laxative.
    It is now, however, scarcely considered purgative,
    and its laxative properties are probably owing in a great
    measure to the senna and other articles which enter into
    its preparation.</p>
<p>The <i>electuary of roses</i>, which is now no longer used,
    was also probably indebted for its medical qualities to the
    addition of scammony, a very strong purgative.</p>
<p><i>Vinegar of roses</i> is made by simply infusing dried
    rose-petals in the best distilled vinegar, to which they
    communicate their perfume. It is used for cooking and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> for the toilet, and for headaches, when applied in the
    same way as common vinegar. The ancients prepared
    this vinegar, and also the wine and oil of roses, which are
    no longer used.</p>
<p><i>Honey of roses</i> is made by beating up rose-petals with
    a very small portion of boiling water; the liquid, after
    being filtered, is boiled with honey. This is esteemed for
    sore throats, for ulcers in the mouth, and for anything
    that is benefited by the use of honey.</p>
<p>The fruit of the rose is said also to possess some astringent
    properties; the pulp of the fruit of the wild varieties,
    particularly of the dog rose, after being separated
    from the seeds and beaten up in a mortar with sugar,
    makes a sort of conserve, formerly known in medicine
    under the name of Cynorrhodon.</p>
<p>Children in the country sometimes eat these fruits after
    they have attained perfect maturity, and have been somewhat
    mellowed by the frost; they then lose their pungent
    taste, and become a little sweet. Belanger, a French
    writer, who traveled in Persia in 1825, found in that
    country a rose whose fruit was very agreeably flavored.
    The apple-bearing rose (<i>R. villosa pomifera</i>) produces the
    largest fruit of all, and is the best adapted for preserving;
    but an English writer remarks that the fruit of <i>R. systyla</i> and <i>R. arvensis</i>, although of a smaller size, bears a higher
    flavor than that of any other species. Rose-buds, like
    the fruit, are also frequently preserved in sugar, and
    pickled in vinegar. Tea is sometimes made of the leaves
    of the rose, which are also eaten readily by the domestic
    animals.</p>
<p>The ends of the young shoots of the sweet-brier, deprived
    of their bark and foliage, and cut into short pieces,
    are sometimes candied and sold by the confectioners.</p>
<p>The Dog Rose takes its name from the virtue which
    the ancients attributed to its root as a cure for hydrophobia.
    The heathen deities themselves, according to Pliny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> revealed this marvelous property, in dream, to a mother
    whose son had been bitten by a dog affected with this
    terrible disease.</p>
<p>The excrescences frequently found on the branches of
    the Rose, and particularly on those of the wild varieties,
    known to druggists by the Arabic name of <i>bédeguar</i>, and
    which resemble in form a little bunch of moss, partake
    equally of the astringent properties of the Rose. These
    excrescences are caused by the puncture of a little insect,
    known to naturalists as the <i>Cynips rosæ</i>, and, occasionally,
    nearly the same effects are produced by other insects.</p>

<h3>GENERAL REMARKS.</h3>
<p>The name of the Rose is very similar in most languages,
    but of its primitive derivation very little or nothing is
    known. It is <i>rhodon</i> in Greek; rhos, in Celtic; <i>rosa</i>, in
    Latin, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Hungarian, and Polish; <i>rose</i>, in French, Saxon, and English; <i>rosen</i>, in German; <i>roose</i>, in Dutch; <i>rhoshà</i>, in Sclavonic; <i>ros</i>, in Irish; <i>ruoze</i>,
    in Bohemian; <i>ouasrath</i>, in Arabic; <i>nisrin</i>, in Turkish; <i>chabhatzeleth</i>, in Hebrew; and <i>gul</i>, in Persian. These are
    the various names by which the flower has been known
    from very early times, and a strong resemblance can be
    traced through all. The Latin name, <i>rosa</i>, also forms a
    component part of terms used to designate several other
    things.</p>
<p>The name of <i>rosary</i> was given to a string of beads used
    in the Romish Church to represent a certain number of
    prayers; it was instituted about the year 667, but was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> much used until Peter the Hermit excited the Christian
    nations to the Crusade, about 1096. Dominique, a Romish
    saint, established, in 1207, the brotherhood of the Rosary,
    and the festival of the Rose was instituted in 1571 by
    Pope Pius V., in thanksgiving for the victory gained by
    the Christians over the Turks at Lepante. Subsequent
    popes gave to that ceremony more éclat, and caused it to
    be established in Spain. The name of <i>rosary</i> was formerly
    also given to the vessel used in distilling rose-water.
    The Rose has also given the idea of new forms of beauty
    in architecture and the arts. A rose is sometimes sculptured
    in the centre of each face of a Corinthian capital.
    It is also frequently seen in iron castings for the banisters
    of the stone steps of a house, and it is sometimes displayed
    upon the pavement in front of some splendid mansion.
    This, however, is rare in the United States, although frequent
    in Europe.</p>
<p>Among all the imitations of the Rose, none can compare
    with those painted on glass, some of which can be found
    in the windows of celebrated European Cathedrals in
    Canterbury, Cologne, Milan, Rheims, St. Denis, and others.
    We can scarcely imagine anything more beautifully
    soft than these paintings on glass, as seen from the interior
    of a church, in the rich light of a glowing sunset; the
    Rose thus painted seems to possess all the freshness and
    beauty of the real flower.</p>
<p>The nave of the Cathedral of Paris, besides twenty-four
    large windows, is lighted by three others, large and magnificent,
    in the shape of a Rose, which are each forty feet
    in diameter. The paintings on glass which ornament
    these windows were executed in the 13th century, and
    still retain their fresh and bright colors: that over the
    grand entrance represents the signs of the zodiac, and the
    agricultural labors of each month.</p>
<p>In heraldry, the rose frequently forms part of a shield,
    in full bloom, with a bud in the centre, and with five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> points to imitate thorns; it is an emblem of beauty and
    of nobility acquired with difficulty.</p>
<p>The Golden Rose was considered so honorable a present,
    that none but monarchs were worthy to receive it.</p>
<p>In the 11th century, the Pope introduced the custom of
    blessing a golden Rose, which he presented to some church,
    or to some prince or princess, as an especial mark of his
    favor.</p>
<p>In 1096, the Pope Urban II. gave a Golden Rose to the
    Comte d&rsquo;Anjou. Alexander III. sent one to Louis, King
    of France, in acknowledgment of the attentions of that
    prince during the Pope&rsquo;s visit to France, as stated in a
    letter which he wrote the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In accordance with the custom of our ancestors, in
    carrying a rose of gold in their hands on Dimanche Lætare,
    we do not think we can present it to one who merits it
    more than yourself, from your devotion to the Church and
    to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pope John, in 1415, sent the Golden Rose to the Emperor
    Sigismund. Martin V., in 1418, sent another to the
    same prince. Pius II., in 1461, sent one to Thomas Paleologue,
    Emperor of Constantinople. Henry VIII., of
    England, before his separation from the Church of Rome,
    received the Golden Rose twice; the first from Julius II.,
    and the second from Leo X.; and in 1842, the Pope&rsquo;s
    Nuncio Capaccini presented it to Donna Maria, Queen
    of Portugal. Isabella, Queen of Spain, was presented
    with it a few years since.</p>
<p>The public ceremony of blessing the Rose was not instituted
    until 1366, by Urban V.: that pontiff, wishing to
    give a particular mark of his esteem to Joanna, Queen of
    Sicily, solemnly blessed a Golden Rose, which he sent her,
    and made at the same time a decree, that a similar one
    should be consecrated every year. For fifty or sixty
    years, the Pope gave the Rose to princes who came to
    Rome; and it was the custom to give 500 louis to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> officer who carried it for the Pope. The Rose, in its intrinsic
    value, was, however, sometimes worth double that
    sum.</p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>We have thus given all the information we have been
    able to collect respecting the history of the Rose.</p>
<p>We shall feel abundantly gratified if the facts and anecdotes
    we have cited shall tend to enhance the already
    growing interest in this flower; and by thus connecting
    it with the lore of antiquity, cast around it a bright halo
    of pleasant associations.</p>
<p>Among the various riches of the garden, there are many
    flowers of great attractions: some we admire for their
    beautiful forms, others for their brilliant colors, and others
    again for their delightful fragrance; and we scarcely
    know which to pronounce the most pleasing. But whatever
    may be our feelings of admiration for these beautiful
    flowers, a desire for something still more beautiful draws
    us to the Rose, and compels us to pronounce it superior
    to all its rivals. It is the Rose alone that never fatigues,
    that always exhibits some new beauty, and that is never
    affected by fashion; for while Dahlias and other flowers
    have had their hour of favor, and have passed out of notice,
    the Rose has been a favorite for some three thousand
    years, and is still the first and most beautiful,&mdash;the <i>chef
    d&rsquo;&#339;uvre</i> of the vegetable kingdom.</p>
<p>The Rose is rendered a favorite by many pleasant associations.
    It has been the cherished flower of the ancient
    poets, and with modern poets it has lost none of its
    charms, but is still apostrophized and made an object of
    frequent comparison. With the ancients, it was, as we
    have seen, the ornament of their festivals, their altars,
    and their tombs: it was the emblem of beauty, youth,
    modesty, and innocence, and was full of tender sentiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> and pleasant images. A French writer, in a somewhat
    more extravagant vein of laudation, says, &ldquo;Its name alone
    gives birth in all sensible minds to a crowd of pleasant
    thoughts, while, at the same time, it excites a sensation
    of the most delightful pleasures, and the most sweet enjoyments.&rdquo;
    The name of &ldquo;Queen of Flowers,&rdquo; has been
    given to the Rose, almost from time immemorial; but
    this name is particularly applicable to the <i>R. centifolia</i> and the hybrids from it. Yet the little, modest wild rose,
    found only in woods and hedges, adorns the solitude
    where it grows, and possesses for many a charm not surpassed
    by that of any of the cultivated varieties: its
    regularly formed corolla, of a soft and delicate color, combines
    in its simplicity many an attraction not found in the
    most beautiful flowers of the garden; and late in the season,
    when the fields are stripped of their verdure, the
    landscape is enlivened by the bright appearance of its red,
    coral-like fruit.</p>
<p>The beauty of the Rose has preserved it and its reputation
    for many ages. The most populous nations, the
    largest cities, the most wealthy and powerful kingdoms,
    have disappeared from the earth, or have been involved in
    the revolutions and subversions of empires, while a simple
    flower has escaped them all, and still remains to tell
    its story. It has seen a hundred generations succeed each
    other, and pass away; it has traveled through ages without
    changing its destiny or losing its character: the homage
    rendered and the love borne it have been always the
    same: now, as in the earliest periods of the world&rsquo;s history,
    it is decreed the first place in the floral kingdom. In
    these days, as in those of antiquity, it is <i>par excellence</i>,
    the Queen of Flowers, because it is always the most beautiful,
    and because no other flower can furnish half its
    charms. To elegance and beauty of form it unites the
    freshness and brilliance of the most agreeable colors, and,
    as if nature had showered upon it all her most precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> gifts, it adds to its other qualities a delightful perfume,
    which alone would suffice to entitle it to a distinguished
    place among the beautiful and pleasant things of the vegetable
    kingdom.</p>
